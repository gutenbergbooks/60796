THE SECOND MATE

<h3>
I
</h3>

<p>
The <i>Sulu Queen</i> was steaming south at an
eight-knot clip, which for her was
exceedingly good, bound for Macassar, Singapore
and way ports, according to the dispensation
of Providence.  Her tail shaft was likely to
go at any minute; she had an erratic list to
starboard; her pumps could barely keep down
the water that seeped through her loose plates;
but she was going.  Just to be going was an
achievement for the <i>Sulu Queen</i>.  She was
certain not to be going for very long.
</p>

<p>
Her Macaense&mdash;or Portuguese Eurasian&mdash;skipper
was enjoying an opium dream in his
cabin.  Her chief engineer, a one-eyed
Cyclops who had long since buried his Glasgow
accent under a maze of tropic profanity, was
dead drunk.  Her black gang was composed
of Macao coolies.  Her men forward were
lascars, under a mild-eyed Malay serang who
was an escaped murderer from Bilibid Prison.
Her two quartermasters were Chinese, and
efficient.  Her supercargo was a Straits
Chinese comprador, a Singapore man.  Her mate
was a hulking Dutchman, rotten with gin
alow and aloft.  Her second mate was Jim
Barnes, for whose labor all these others drew
pay.
</p>

<p>
She carried nine passengers.  Abdullah, an
Arab merchant, was going home to Macassar,
taking with him his first wife and five
offspring.  How the Slave of God, as his name
bore witness, ever got to Canton with so many,
was a mystery; what had become of the other
three lawful wives, not to mention the unlawful
ones, was a greater mystery.  The other
two passengers were Nora Sayers and Ellen
Maggs.
</p>

<p>
They were missionaries of some kind in
China, had been ordered to voyage for their
health, and as their funds were low, had taken
the <i>Sulu Queen</i>.  Jim Barnes had been too
busy to ask questions.  He would have
welcomed them on the bridge, except that the
Dutchman and the chief were both up there,
nearly naked and rather soused.  They had
been there in that condition since leaving
Cantop.  When he explained the matter to them,
Ellen Maggs blushed faintly, and Nora Sayers
was quite willing to come along anyhow;
but Ellen prevailed.
</p>

<p>
At two bells in the morning watch, Jim
Barnes heaved a huge sigh of relief and left
the bridge, which he had perforce held since
before midnight.  The islands were past;
Simonor was dropping astern into the
horizon and ahead was the open Celebes Sea and a
clear course for Macassar.  By some miracle
the coral reefs had been evaded.
</p>

<p>
Jim Barnes sought the galley and obtained
some tea from the yellow cook.  He gulped
it down and then started for his own cabin,
meaning to get some sleep.  The quartermaster
of his watch had the bridge and a fair
course.
</p>

<p>
Then, at the door af his stateroom, he
paused with a sudden oath.  The course was
south by a quarter east; to his amazement,
Barnes discovered that the ship was swinging
around until the sun was almost astern.
</p>

<p>
With another oath of weary, wondering disgust,
he started for the ladder.  As he touched
it, he heard his name spoken, and glanced
around.  The other quartermaster, Li Fu by
name, was gliding toward him, and the yellow
face was gleaming with inward excitement.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" demanded Barnes.
</p>

<p>
"Maste', you watch out velly sha'p!"
exclaimed Li Fu, low-voiced, tense.  "Bad
piecee bobbery kick up, mebbeso two bells
this afte'noon!  I think mebbeso all hands
talkee-talkee make fo' mutiny.  Cap'n he say
fo' tell you come see him."
</p>

<p>
"You tell the skipper to go to hell," said
Barnes.  "Opium crazy, that's what he is.
Mutiny.  Good gosh, we've nothing to mutiny for!"
</p>

<p>
"Cap'n he say head in fo' Sesajap,"
persisted the Chinaman.
</p>

<p>
Jim Barnes groaned.  "Head in for Sesajap,
eh?  Heading in for Borneo&mdash;the skipper
changed the course, did he?  That why
we're turning?"
</p>

<p>
Li Fu nodded, beady eyes alert.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I've no time now to palaver with
that cursed Eurasian topside," said Barnes
bluntly.  "You tell him to take the bridge
or chase Vanderhoof up there&mdash;I'm done.
Savvy?  I'm going to sleep.  Let everybody
mutiny and be damned.  I'm the only seaman
aboard this cursed packet anyhow.  I'm tired
o' doing ten men's work.  Trouble coming this
afternoon, is it?  Then let afternoon take care
of itself.  I'll be ready to take the deck after
this watch is over&mdash;noon.  And, listen!  Tell
the cap'n that if he don't shoot the sun and
verify his position after this running around,
he'll land us all in hell.  You savvy that?
Then tell him from me.  And if he wants to
run us into Borneo, let him do it!"
</p>

<p>
Li Fu grinned delightedly and stated that
he savvied plenty.  He, like any efficient
seaman, had no use for the other officers and
regarded Jim Barnes as a little tin god.  Jim
Barnes went into his cabin, locked the door,
stuck a chair under the knob, and then
dropped on his bunk, dead to the world.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Down in the engine-room, where the heat
had sent the chief into a drunken stupor, the
Malay serang conferred with the two assistant
engineers.  They were both men of color,
being Macaense like the skipper, but not, like
him, owning a large share in the <i>Sulu Queen</i>.
Filling his mouth with betel paste, expectorating
a scarlet stream across the floor under the
ladder, the serang spoke as he squatted there
with the two engineers.
</p>

<p>
"The supercargo, Lim Tock, is a very clever
man.  He has arranged everything into shares;
there will be one hundred shares made of
everything.  Fifty of these will be divided
among the men, the other fifty among us, the
officers."
</p>

<p>
"Good," assented the second engineer.
"How many are in it, Gajah?"
</p>

<p>
Gajah, the serang, spat again, and his soft
eyes glowed luminously.
</p>

<p>
"All the men, here and above.  The
wireless man, the two quartermasters, <i>Tuan</i>
Barnes, and the cap'n must be killed.  <i>Tuan</i>
Vanderhoof will navigate the ship.  He is a
great coward, and after his feet are burned he
will be glad to serve us.  This chief engineer
must be killed, too.  Six altogether.  You will
attend to this chief."
</p>

<p>
The two Eurasians looked at each other,
then at the supinely snoring figure of the chief.
They grinned and nodded.  The chief would
be drunk again after tiffin.
</p>

<p>
"You are sure of the men?" asked the third.
</p>

<p>
"Of course," said Gajah.  "Lim Tock
shipped them carefully at Canton, and my
own men are picked for the purpose."
</p>

<p>
"Why has the course been changed?"
demanded the second engineer.
</p>

<p>
"Because I whispered into the ear of the
cap'n," said Gajah, with a meditative smile.
"I told him that I knew a chief at one of the
islands in the mouth of the Sesajap River,
who had a great deal of gold dust, many birds'
nests, and some fine pearls and shell.  The
<i>tuan</i> cap'n is very greedy.  He changed the
course immediately."
</p>

<p>
"Is there such a man?" asked the third.
Gajah grinned in derision.
</p>

<p>
"Why not?  Once I knew such a man at
Sibuko, which is not far away.  He was the
second cousin of my elder brother's third wife,
and he was very rich.  I went to visit him,
and induced his youngest wife to run away
with me.  But she forgot to bring the pearls
with her, being in love with me, and so I slew
her.  That happened in Manila, and they put
me into prison because of it.  The white <i>tuans</i>
did not understand."
</p>

<p>
"Well, when is this to take place?" asked
the second engineer nervously.
</p>

<p>
"At the striking of two bells in the next
watch."
</p>

<p>
"It shall be done.  Who is to command,
after that?"
</p>

<p>
"The supercargo, Lim Tock," answered the
serang.  "He is very clever.  A friend of his,
also a member of the Lim family, is to meet us
near Bunju Island with a junk of which he is
cap'n.  Since the arrangement is all Lim
Tock's, he deserves to command.  It was he
who got the opium put aboard at Macao."
</p>

<p>
"One thing," put in the third, his dark and
muddy eyes gleaming.  "The two white women!
Surely they are not to be killed?"
</p>

<p>
"One does not waste the gifts of Allah,"
said Gajah sententiously.  "The one with
yellow hair goes to me; the other, who blushes
often and whose figure is that of the willow,
will comfort Lim Tock for the loss of his
eldest son, who was hanged by the English last
month for killing a white <i>tuan</i>.  After a little
while we shall sell them to chiefs along the
coast, and so be rid of them.  <i>Wallah</i>!  It is
hot down here."
</p>

<p>
He arose, knotted his fine silk <i>sarong</i> more
closely about his waist, loosened his shagreen-hilted
kris in its sheath, and departed.  They
two engineers looked at each other, and a slow
smile passed between them.
</p>

<p>
"She of the yellow hair," said the third
reflectively, "is tall and strong, of high spirit,
and a fitting mate for me, whose veins run
with the proud blood of the da Soussas!"
</p>

<p>
"And she of the lissome body," said the
second engineer, rubbing his bristly chin, "has
ere now smiled very sweetly upon me.  It is
not proper that yellow and brown island scum
should have precedence before us, men
descended from the conquistadors!"
</p>

<p>
"I agree with you," responded the other.
"But what are we to do?"
</p>

<p>
"First secure the ship," said the second
promptly.  "Then secure&mdash;what we want."
</p>

<p>
"Good!" agreed the third engineer with
emphasis.  "Let us consider the matter."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Meantime, in the chart-house Li Fu had
delivered the second mate's message to the
befuddled skipper, who sat dreamily over his
charts.  The message was literally delivered,
but it could not stir the captain into action.
He was lost in the reverie of contemplation
that comes of good opium; not actual dreams,
as some think, but a complacent sweetishness
in the mind that shoves aside all immediate
problems and refuses to take a crisis seriously.
</p>

<p>
The captain, indeed, was a lost soul.
Usually your opium-eater cannot smoke the drug
at all, and the smoker cannot attain Nirvana
by eating it.  This Macaense, however, both
ate and smoked, thereby letting damnation
into himself by two channels.  He was a thin,
pasty man, once of powerful physique, but
now rather rickety on his pins.
</p>

<p>
"One hundred and seventy miles to the
mouth of the Sesajap," he murmured.  "We
shall reach it at five o'clock tomorrow morning."
</p>

<p>
He gave over thinking and plucked
vacuously at his thin mustaches.
</p>

<p>
"Providing the engines hold," added Li Fu,
who spoke better Portuguese than English.
"If the night is clear, there will be a new
moon.  We should sight the coast by midnight."
</p>

<p>
"The engines!" repeated the skipper.
"Where is the chief?  He was here an hour
ago."
</p>

<p>
"He went below, sir.  The mate woke up
and went into the wheel-house."
</p>

<p>
"Bring him here, Li Fu."
</p>

<p>
The quartermaster went out of the
chart-house, presently to return alone.
</p>

<p>
"He is asleep, sir.  We cannot wake him."
</p>

<p>
"Drunk, eh?  Never mind, never mind.  I
will take the observation myself at noon&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"And at two bells, sir," reminded Li Fu
cautiously.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you are a fool, Quartermaster!  These
men will not mutiny.  There is no reason for
it.  You are not used to Lascars and must not
be a fool.  I shall go to rest and make ready
my instruments.  The course is to be held as
it is."
</p>

<p>
The captain rose and, with a sigh of relief
that no more duty presented itself, made his
way back to his cabin.
</p>

<p>
Li Fu studied the outspread chart and
lighted a cigarette.  After a while, the other
quartermaster left the wheel lashed and came
into the chart-house, also lighting a cigarette.
The two men greeted each other quietly.
Like Li Fu, Quartermaster Hi John was a
stalwart, efficient seaman, calm and well
poised.  He addressed Li Fu in the Cantonese
dialect.
</p>

<p>
"You told him, Li?"
</p>

<p>
"I told him," said Li Fu.  "He went to
sleep.  He was very weary."
</p>

<p>
"Did you find out why the captain changed
the course?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  He thinks more about his <i>hap toi</i>
than about what I ask him.  I woke up the
chief and told him, but he was too drunk to
understand.  He asked if there was no help
for the widow's son, and went to sleep again.
His mind is gone."
</p>

<p>
"The second mate will fight," said Hi John
thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"If he is not slain before he gets a chance."
</p>

<p>
"There remains the wireless officer."
</p>

<p>
"True.  He remains."
</p>

<p>
The two men looked at each other and
smiled mirthlessly.  The wireless man was
the privileged son of a Macaense, chief owner
of the <i>Sulu Queen</i>.  Cumshaw had obtained
his berth; he did not know one end of the
wireless from another, as the quartermasters had
learned when Jim Barnes cursed him for an
idiotic fool.  He was no better than an idiot;
he was, indeed, some degrees worse, since the
diseased degeneracy of Asia was his heritage.
</p>

<p>
"Then you and I are alone," said Hi John.
</p>

<p>
"We are alone.  What answer shall we
make to Lim Tock when the time comes?"
</p>

<p>
Hi John extinguished his cigarette.
</p>

<p>
"Duty is a shining star, Li Fu.  I have a
revolver in my bag."
</p>

<p>
"I have one also," said Li Fu.  "Yet I do
not want to swallow gold."
</p>

<p>
"Nor I; this life is good."  Hi John lighted
another cigarette.  "Still, consider duty!  Lim
Tock is a terrible man.  It was he who sank
the Dutch steamer last year, before his son
was hung.  His son helped him.  They each
got two Dutch women and much money.  If
we do not join him, Li, I think that we shall
both swallow gold."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Then you join him."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no."  Hi John's singsong tones were
soft.  "Oh, no!  I did not mean that."
</p>

<p>
Li Fu looked slightly ironic.  "You think
this ship worth dying for?  Or those white
women beautiful enough to die for?"
</p>

<p>
"Not at all," said Hi John.  "The ship is
a rotten hulk.  The women are ugly and pale
as ghosts.  I care nothing what becomes of
either.  At the same time, I revere the
wisdom of my paternal parent, who was also an
officer in a ship.  Before he swallowed gold,
he asked me to take an oath, that I would
never swerve from my duty.  Therefore I
cannot well join Lim Tock, since I undertook
a certain duty aboard this ship."
</p>

<p>
"That is true," said Li Fu.  "I have no
oath to restrain me, but my duty needs no
oath.  Therefore I agree with you fully.  I
shall get my revolver, and also yours, while
you are on the bridge; I have had it two
rice-years, but it is a good one."
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said Hi John.  "Give me
mine when you have the opportunity."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
While these two men talked on the bridge-deck,
Lim Tock, the super-cargo, walked aft
on the main-deck, past the dingy passenger-cabins
where the brood of Abdullah swarmed
about the two "missionary ladies."  Lim Tock
was an elderly Straits Chinaman, with a short,
gray mustache, a drawn, parchment face, and
two bright and glittering gray eyes&mdash;a most
amazing pair of eyes to be staring from a
saffron face!  Yet some Chinese are gray-eyed.
</p>

<p>
In the stern, he came upon Abdullah, the
Arab merchant, who was reading a Koran.
The Arab looked up, smiled slightly, and
spoke in the Low Malay which most men use
in the island seas.  This Slave of God was a
thin and deadly looking person, fierce with his
hook nose and jutting shreds of beard and
jetty eyes.
</p>

<p>
"All is arranged?"
</p>

<p>
"It is arranged," said Lim Tock.  "You
agree to take the white women off our hands?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; and to ask no other share of the rewards."
</p>

<p>
Lim Tock inclined his head and passed on
around to the starboard passage.  There he
came upon Gajah, the serang, busy doing
nothing.  To him Lim Tock spoke in High
Malay, a tongue which very few men know or
understand, even in the island seas.
</p>

<p>
"Abdullah suspects nothing.  His boxes
will be rich plunder.  Let him be the first to
fall, and his children after him&mdash;a clean
sweep."
</p>

<p>
"And the woman, his wife?" asked the
Lascar serang.
</p>

<p>
"She has borne many and is past pleasing.
Let her accompany Abdullah."
</p>

<p>
The serang nodded indifferently and Lim
Tock went his way.
</p>

<p>
While men thus talked and schemed and
counseled together alow and aloft, Jim Barnes
slept.

<p>
Nora Sayers was tall and active, with
brilliant yellow hair and very deep
violet eyes; a young woman of great energy, who
had seen too much bloodshed in the revolutionary
fighting around Pekin, and who had
turned her mission station into a hospital of
tortured men.  Ellen Maggs, smaller, very
slender and frail in looks, was newer to China,
but she, too, had seen so many horrors that the
powers above had thought best to send both
women away on a sea voyage in company.
Ellen Maggs, however, had more steel
beneath her quiet and old-fashioned exterior
than men imagined possible.
</p>

<p>
When they entered the mess saloon at eight
bells, noon, they were not surprised to find
themselves alone.  They had by this time
grown used to the peculiar conditions
prevailing aboard the <i>Sulu Queen</i>.  The chief had a
lurking sense of shame that kept him from
their presence.  The captain had the bridge.
The wireless officer came in, bowed very
effusively, and seated himself.  He could speak
no English, and listened staringly to the
laughter and light chatter of the two women.
Abdullah and his family ate by themselves.
</p>

<p>
Presently Jim Barnes entered, bathed and
shaven and with his usual air of radiating
high good-humor.  Almost at the same
moment came Vanderhoof, eyes bloodshot, walk
unsteady, to seat himself with a grunt and
absorb quantities of coffee and rice-curry.  He
gave Barnes a scowling regard across the table.
</p>

<p>
"Der cap'n say for you to take der pridge,"
he growled.
</p>

<p>
"Not me," said Barnes pleasantly.  "Now
that we've open sea ahead, you and he can do
a little work, Van.  Everything's galley-west
aboard this hooker, and the watches might as
well go with the rest."
</p>

<p>
The yellow steward set an open gin-bottle
beside the mate, who poured a tumbler full,
then glared at Barnes.
</p>

<p>
"By chiminy," he said, "d'you refuse to
opey orders, huh?"
</p>

<p>
"You bet I do," said Jim Barnes, his eyes
twinkling.  "And if you know what's good
for your health, Van, you'll sober up before
you try to give me any.  Savvy that?"
</p>

<p>
Despite the cheerful accent, something in
the steady and level regard of the second mate
caused Vanderhoof to drink down his gin
without making any response.  When he had
emptied the bottle, he shoved back his chair
and left the cabin.
</p>

<p>
"Well, ladies," said Barnes, "how do you
find yourselves this morning?  Rather warm
last night.  Did your fan work all right?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite, thanks," and Nora Sayers smiled.
"Aren't you just a trifle independent with
your superior officers, Mr. Barnes?  I thought
all sailors were very polite&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Barnes grinned.  "Oh, me and Van?  Don't
pay any attention to that, Miss Sayers.  He
was just trying to show his authority in front
of you and Miss Maggs."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!"  Nora Sayers laughed.  "Isn't it
mutiny to refuse to obey orders?"
</p>

<p>
"Not aboard this packet.  The skipper has
been hitting the pipe all morning and now
he's got us headed slap for Borneo.  Lord
knows why; I don't."
</p>

<p>
Ellen Maggs smiled shyly.
</p>

<p>
"You're the most happily irresponsible
person I ever met, Mr. Barnes," she said.  "And
so is this ship.  Every voyage in her must be
a delightful adventure, if it's like this one!
Have you been with her long?"
</p>

<p>
"This is my first and last," said Barnes
drily.  "You can't say that you've enjoyed
yourselves so far, can you?"
</p>

<p>
"I have, every minute of it!" exclaimed
Ellen Maggs, an unwonted sparkle in her
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"And so have I," asserted Nora Sayers with
energy.  "Look at the queer people we've
met!  This funny little man down the table,
who stares and giggles&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"He's part idiot," interjected Jim Barnes.
"But who else?"
</p>

<p>
"All of them!  The poor old captain, with
his politeness and queer abstractions and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The old man's only forty," and Barnes
chuckled.  "But the hops gets 'em early.  So
you like the Eurasians, do you?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't like them, no, but they're interesting,"
stated Miss Sayers.  "And the chief engineer
is queer, too, only he won't talk&mdash;=="
</p>

<p>
"I was talking with him early this morning,"
put in Ellen Maggs.  "He's a dear old
man, Nora.  He was telling me all about his
early life in Scotland."
</p>

<p>
"He always does," put in Jim Barnes,
"when he's in the middle of a big spree.  Oh,
don't look shocked!  Won't do any good.  I
guess you ladies are disappointed that you
didn't find another queer duck in the second
officer's shoes, eh?  Or am I queer, too?"
</p>

<p>
"You're just human," declared Miss
Sayers promptly.  "Only you're too busy to be
very polite."
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to be busier yet, right after
lunch," said Jim Barnes.  "Oh, Steward!
Get me some more of that curry."
</p>

<p>
"Why, what have you found now to keep
you occupied?" asked Ellen Maggs, interested.
</p>

<p>
Jim Barnes did not respond until the steward
had left the cabin.  Then he spoke cheerfully,
as he sugared his coffee with some care.
</p>

<p>
"Me?  I've got to set the ship afire.  As
soon as they give the alarm, I want you two
ladies to come up to the upper bridge-deck,
and come quick!  I'll be in the chart-house&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You mean that little coop up above the
bridge, with the awning?" asked Nora Sayers.
</p>

<p>
"Just that.  I'll get there before they
discover the blaze."
</p>

<p>
The two women stared at him, then glanced
at each other in perplexed wonder.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean, Mr. Barnes?" demanded
Ellen Maggs, a faint touch of color
in her cheeks.  "Are you joking about getting
the ship afire?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Jim Barnes.  His tone was
unusually crisp, and the look that he gave them
was keen and incisive.  "No.  Don't let out
a peep before the steward, now!  A mutiny is
due to start at one o'clock, and, so far as I can
see, most of the officers will get wiped out at
the first crack.  Mutiny or piracy, I'm not
sure which.  I've got to set the hooker afire
and keep the men so blamed busy they'll have
no time for murder.  Please pass the butter,
Miss Maggs."
</p>

<p>
His matter-of-fact manner made the two
women at first doubt his words, then believe
them with a frightful sense of conviction;
Ellen Maggs stared at him from eyes that
slowly widened.  Glancing up and meeting
her gaze, Jim Barnes was suddenly startled by
the intensity of her look, by the revealed
womanhood he saw in her face; he had not
dreamed that she could look so beautiful.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry I scared you," he said, smilingly.
There was an infectious quality to his smile;
perhaps because of his direct blue eyes,
wrinkled at the corners; perhaps because of his
wide and humorous mouth and strong chin.
"But the steward's coming now&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You're in earnest?" demanded Nora Sayers,
who had gone a little white.
</p>

<p>
"Quite.  Nobody aboard can use the wireless,
unless you ladies can.  Any chance?"
</p>

<p>
Ellen Maggs shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"No chance," she said, and astonished Jim
Barnes by smiling.  "But I have a pistol in
my suitcase&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Fine!" exclaimed Barnes heartily.  The
steward entered with his plate of curry.  "You
get it.  And you girls might as well buckle
down to the fact that before we get through
there's going to be a large slice of the lower
regions laid bare aboard this hooker.  Is that
an engagement ring you're wearing, Miss Sayers?
Pardon personalities; I'm asking for a
reason."
</p>

<p>
"Yes."  Nora Sayers twisted the ring on
her finger.  "It's&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"All right.  If you ever want to add a plain
gold hoop to it, you remember that there's just
one man aboard who can pull you out o' this,
and that's me.  I don't want any interference,
and I do want help.  Get me?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes!" exclaimed Ellen Maggs, and her
eyes were shining.  "Just where do you want
us to come, please?  You spoke about the
chart-house&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Come there, and I'll see you up safe to the
awning deck above.  A little before two bells.
Bring with you anything that you value very
highly.  We may stave off this fuss until
night, in which case we'll be all right.  Well,
cheer up and don't worry!  See you later."
</p>

<p>
Jim Barnes pushed back his chair, produced
his pipe, and began to fill it as he left
the mess saloon.  He stood by the rail a
moment, until his pipe was lighted.
</p>

<p>
"I guess that was laying bare the situation
with a rough and brutal hand," he said, and
chuckled softly.  "Had to be done, though.
And now I've got to step mighty carefully.
Most likely those assistant engineers are in on
the game; they're Eurasians, too, so I can't
take chances.  If anyone suspects that I know
about things, the blow-off will come before
two bells&mdash;which would spoil everything for
me.  But lordy!  What a pippin that little
Maggs girl is!  She's a regular guy."
</p>

<p>
From his language, it might be inferred
that Jim Barnes was an American.
</p>

<p>
Puffing at his pipe, he sought the engine-room.
The chief blinked up at him from a
huge plate of curry.  A glance showed Barnes
that neither of the assistants were about, and
he ventured an open word.
</p>

<p>
"Chief, wake up!  Mutiny is scheduled for
two bells, and if you don't want your throat
cut you'd better be advised&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Get oot o' ma engine-room!" ordered the
chief with dignity.  "Ye drunken scut, can
ye not bear your liquor like a man?  I'll hae
no drunken officers cooming doon here to be
bawlin' o' mutinies in ma ear!  Tak' shame
to yoursel', sir!"
</p>

<p>
Barnes compressed his lips and turned
away.  It was useless.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Sulu Queen</i>, originally a well-decked
tramp, had been fitted up rather shabbily to
carry passengers in the island trade, the after
portion of the deck-house having been added
to for this purpose.  Carrying all the oily
waste he could conceal about his person, Jim
Barnes made his way aft to one of the
unoccupied cabins.  The two white passengers were
not in sight.  In the stern, beneath a tattered
awning, Abdullah sat smoking a water-pipe,
his wife and family around him.
</p>

<p>
"They're safe enough," observed Barnes, as
he ducked into the cabin he sought.  "Even if
the old packet can't get up enough steam to
check the flames, and goes down, they'll be
taken care of.  So, on with the dance!"
</p>

<p>
The fact that he was committing various
sorts of barratry and felony, did not worry
Jim Barnes in the least.
</p>

<p>
The storm season being past, the lookout or
awning-deck above the pilot-house was fitted
up with awning and canvas aprons and some
chairs, but remained almost unused.  The
additional climb of a dozen feet from the
chart-and pilot-house was far too much trouble for
the captain and others; besides which, the
place was no more than a box a dozen feet
square, and was hot.  A single ladder
ascended to it from the bridge deck, which it
overlooked completely.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Shortly before two bells, Jim Barnes
welcomed Ellen Maggs and Nora Sayers, as they
came up to the bridge.  He was alone there,
with Li Fu and two of the lascars in the
chart-house.  Down in the bows, Lim Tock,
the supercargo, was standing in talk with the
steward, and both watches were idling about
the deck.
</p>

<p>
"How do we get upstairs?" asked Ellen Maggs.
</p>

<p>
"Right this way, ladies!" answered Barnes
cheerfully.  "Chairs up there and a couple of
old magazines, as well as a breaker of water
and some other things.  Whatever happens,
don't worry&mdash;and wait for me.  Here you are!"
</p>

<p>
As they vanished up the ladder, he re-entered
the chart-house and addressed the two
lascar seamen.
</p>

<p>
"Run, quick!  One of you to the serang,
the other to Lim Tock.  Say that I smell
smoke, and have search made for fire.  Look
at the bunkers, but don't take off the hatches
until the last thing.  If there's a fire in the
forward hold, call me."
</p>

<p>
A startled glance passed between the two
men, and they jumped for the ladder.  Jim
Barnes turned to the quartermaster, smiling
slightly.
</p>

<p>
"Where is Hi John?"
</p>

<p>
"Him look velly sharp, I think."
</p>

<p>
"We can depend on him?"
</p>

<p>
Li Fu nodded.
</p>

<p>
"All right, then," said Barnes.  "You go
tell him to come up here.  Then take charge
of those lascars and keep 'em out of the after
cabins for a while, until the fire shows itself.
You savvy?  Don't be in any hurry to put it
out, either.  We'll hold this thing off until
night if we can."
</p>

<p>
Across the saffron features flitted a look of
admiration, for Li Fu comprehended the plan
instantly.  Then the quartermaster was gone.
Barnes looked at the chronometer.  It lacked
five minutes of one.
</p>

<p>
"Two bells won't be struck," he thought,
as he swung the wheel.
</p>

<p>
He grinned at sight of the commotion
below.  Lim Tock was yelling orders at those
of the black gang whom he could see.  Gajah,
the serang, was whistling at his lascars shrilly.
Then he remembered the chief engineer, and
rang the bell.  One of the assistants answered
in the tube.
</p>

<p>
"Ship's on fire," said Jim Barnes, chuckling
to himself.  "Stop your engines and keep
up a full head o' steam for the hose."
</p>

<p>
Hi John appeared, gave Barnes a brief nod
and a grin, and took the wheel.  There had
never been any fire drill aboard the <i>Sulu
Queen</i> in the memory of man, but Barnes
blew the whistle nevertheless and added to
the confusion.  Vanderhoof's bellow arose
from below, followed by an outburst of yells
and shouts from aft.
</p>

<p>
"They've found it," said Barnes.
</p>

<p>
He went to the bridge rail and glanced aft.
A trail of smoke and steam was veering out
in the wake of the steamer.  Barnes listened
for a little to the sounds of tumultuous
confusion, then rejoined the quartermaster.
</p>

<p>
"How did you and Li Fu know so much
about this mutiny?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Talkee-talkee," rejoined Hi John curtly.
"My savvy lascar talk plenty."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Understand Malay, do you?  Good
work.  What reason have they to mutiny?"
</p>

<p>
Hi John had picked up a good deal of
information.  He knew that the rich boxes of
the merchant Abdullah were to be looted, and
that there was a large amount of opium down
below, to be transferred to a Chinese junk and
landed somewhere along the Bornean coast.
Undoubtedly, the <i>Sulu Queen</i> was to be
stripped of everything valuable, then quietly
sunk in deep water.  Lim Tock was in it, the
serang Gajah was in it, and the Chinese junk
was in it; so were some of the officers and all
the men aboard.
</p>

<p>
Reluctantly Jim Barnes became convinced
that to strive against the inevitable would be
useless.  Except for these two Chinese, he
could depend upon no one.  Had he been
alone on the ship, his actions would have been
simple and perhaps effectual.
</p>

<p>
"I'd like to go down there and shoot the
supercargo, the serang, and a few of the men,
and get the old hooker into port," he said to
Hi John.  "But the safety of those two white
women is worth more than this damned old
carcass of a boat.  I can't risk it."
</p>

<p>
Hi John looked bewildered at this reasoning,
which he could not understand.  At this
instant Li Fu came up the port ladder,
panting, and grinned as he saluted Barnes.
</p>

<p>
"Mutiny makee, no matter!  I think they
wait, same time tonight, mebbeso."
</p>

<p>
"Two bells evening watch?" demanded
Barnes.
</p>

<p>
"Aye, sir.  Cap'n say go ahead on course,
he makee fire go out."
</p>

<p>
Barnes rang for full speed ahead, then
questioned Li Fu.  Both the skipper and
Vanderhoof were in charge, it seemed, and were
fighting the fire.  Vanderhoof was somewhat
sobered by the danger; the captain was almost
incapacitated and was acting like an old
woman, according to Li.  The quartermaster
was highly disgusted.  It was the effort of the
serang, whose lascars were working hard, that
was putting the fire under control.
</p>

<p>
Presently the skipper himself appeared,
He was breathing hard and was all in a
tremble.  He wiped his pallid brow and cursed
heartily.
</p>

<p>
"Fire under?" asked Barnes.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, or soon will be.  No matter at
all.  Very disturbing," panted the captain.
"I must obtain some rest, must verify our
position.  Keep her as she is, sir."
</p>

<p>
He looked around, nervously fingered the
chart, then departed.  Barnes looked after
him in contempt, then went to the ladder
leading above.
</p>

<p>
"Gone for a few pipes, the swine!" he
muttered, then looked up and raised his voice.
"Come on down, girls.  Mutiny's postponed
until tonight.  False alarm and nobody killed
yet."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
III
</h3>

<p>
"What part are you from?" asked Jim
Barnes.
</p>

<p>
"Illinois," said Ellen Maggs.  "From
Elgin, where they make watches.  Were you
ever there?"
</p>

<p>
"No closer than the outside of a watch,"
responded Barnes.  "But now I'm going there
some day."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"To see where you came from."
</p>

<p>
Ellen Maggs laughed a little and actually
forgot to blush.
</p>

<p>
"Do it again," said Barnes.
</p>

<p>
"Do what?"
</p>

<p>
"Laugh that way.  It's the prettiest thing
I ever saw."
</p>

<p>
Ellen blushed at that, then turned as Nora
Sayers joined them.
</p>

<p>
"Nora!  Mr. Barnes comes from Baltimore,
too!  He was born there!"
</p>

<p>
"Good for him!"  Nora Sayers laughed in
her hearty, energetic fashion.  "Perhaps you
know my father there, Mr. Barnes&mdash;the
physician, Doctor Sayers?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't know anybody there," admitted Jim
Barnes.  "I've been at sea ever since the war
finished up, and before.  But I'm going to
settle down some day, across the bay from San
Francisco.  Ever been there, Miss Maggs?"
</p>

<p>
"Only when I came out to China."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Jim Barnes, in his whimsical
[Transcriber's note: line of text missing from source book]
all picked out!  A fine little bungalow on one
of the hills at Sausalito, where you can see the
ships all up and down the bay, and the
campanile at Berkeley clear across&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Have you got the girl picked out, too?"
asked Nora Sayers amusedly.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Jim Barnes, in his whimsical
way, "I didn't have up to a couple of weeks
ago, but lately I've sort of got my mind made
up.  By the way, girls, you'd better get all
ready.  We're going to leave the ship in an
hour or two."
</p>

<p>
"Leave her?" they repeated as one, in
dismayed accents.  "How?"
</p>

<p>
"You'll see.  I'll take the bridge when
watches are changed at eight bells&mdash;eight
o'clock.  You come up to the bridge a little
before then, and stick around.  Excuse me,
now; I'll have to pack a few things myself."
</p>

<p>
Barnes hurried away, leaving the two
women at the rail.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Dinner was over, a meal from which all
three were glad to escape, coming out on deck
to find the sun gone and the afterglow staining
the horizon like old church windows.  A
tragic affair, that dinner!  The captain was
ill and did not appear; Vanderhoof was on
deck, more drunk than usual; the second
engineer quarreled with the wireless cub, who
lost his head in a fit of idiotic rage and had to
be taken away and locked up, screaming
curses.  The chief engineer was also locked in
his own cabin, enjoying a spell of "the horrors."
</p>

<p>
Wishing vainly that he understood something
about the wireless outfit, Barnes sought
his cabin and packed up the few belongings
that he wished to take from the ship.  While
he was at this task, Li Fu knocked at the door
and entered hurriedly.
</p>

<p>
"Hello!  What news?  Is it set for two
bells?"
</p>

<p>
Li Fu assented.  He was bursting with
laughter over some joke of the cruel Chinese
variety, and Barnes presently learned what it
was.  He was ordering Li to warn Abdullah
of what was intended, with the intent to get
the Arab's family away safely, when the
quartermaster exploded in a laugh and reported a
conversation that he had overheard among
some of the lascars.
</p>

<p>
It appeared that Abdullah was as much in
the plot as anyone, and was to receive as his
booty the two white women.  The assistant
engineers had an eye on the same prey; while
Lim Tock and Gajah, the serang, were
equally concerned.  To the Chinese, this was
a huge jest all around, for it meant that the
wolves would turn and rend each other.
</p>

<p>
"Hell!" said Jim Barnes.  "I hate to leave
the kids here.  But go ahead, now; and tell
Hi John to attend to the engines as soon as he
goes off watch, then to get up to the bridge
and stand by.  Have you got the boat ready?"
</p>

<p>
"Aye, sir," assented Li Fu.  "Plenty wate';
eve'ything leady."
</p>

<p>
"On your way, then!"
</p>

<p>
Barnes made his way to the bridge, where
Hi John and two lascars were in charge, and
passed behind the chart-house unremarked.
Vanderhoof was not in evidence.  Aboard the
<i>Sulu Queen</i> the clear night was already
insufferably warm, for she was steaming with the
wind.
</p>

<p>
Passing to the centre starboard boat, Barnes
found the cover loosely in place.  He put in
his few effects, then gave his attention to the
lines.  Like most old ships of a past
generation, the steamer was equipped with Clifford's
lowering gear, the most beautiful boat-gear
ever devised, in theory, permitting a boat to
be lowered by slacking a single line.  This
was the boat carried for use in emergencies.
It was not stowed in chocks but was swung out
and left clear, secured by gripes to a toggle
which could be slipped in ah instant.
</p>

<p>
"If we have luck she'll do," thought Barnes,
examining the lowering line.  "The pendants
are new line and not swelled; we ought to get
down without spilling.  Hm!  If anybody'd
ever told me that I'd owe life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness to this cursed ancient
Clifford gear, I'd have called him a liar!  But
wait.  We're not off yet by a long shot."
</p>

<p>
True enough.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
An automatic in either side pocket of his
jacket, Jim Barnes took over the bridge from
Hi John as eight bells struck.  Then, dismay
seized upon him.  His own lack of foresight
had brought on the crisis before he wanted or
expected it!  Ellen Maggs and Nora Sayers
were on the bridge.  They had brought some
personal effects, each in a small grip; and
from the look cast at them by the departing
lascar wheelmen, Barnes knew that suspicion
was up.
</p>

<p>
Two fresh lascars came to the wheel, with
Li Fu.  Disregarding these, Barnes made a
slight gesture to Hi John, who slipped out of
sight instantly on his errand below.  Unless
the engines were disabled, Barnes knew that
his preparations were of no avail.  He greeted
the two women with his usual air of cheerful
assurance, however.
</p>

<p>
"All ready?  Fine!  The two quartermasters
are with us.  Come along, now, and climb
into the boat&mdash;no time to lose, I assure you!
In ten minutes this ship is going to be
about the unhealthiest spot you ever heard
of."
</p>

<p>
He led them around the chart-house toward
the boat.
</p>

<p>
"But the captain!" protested Nora Sayers.
"Surely, if you know there will be some
trouble, the other officers&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Nix," said Barnes.  "Good Lord, girl!
Haven't you seen already what sort o' swine
the others are?  Hear that so-called wireless
officer scream?  He's still off his head&mdash;and
couldn't send a message if he were sane.  And
the old man's soggy with opium.  Here you
are!  Step on this water breaker, and over
into her; she's solid."
</p>

<p>
Indeed, his words were given emphasis by
the screaming of the wireless man, which had
broken out anew down below.  Miss Sayers
stepped to the breaker, and Barnes helped her
up into the boat.  Then he turned, picked up
Ellen Maggs bodily and lifted her over the
edge, laughing as he did so.
</p>

<p>
"Got your pistol?  Good.  Sit tight, and
don't scream when things bust loose.  See you
later."
</p>

<p>
He left them hurriedly and returned to the
wheel, fighting down his appalling helplessness
to prevent what was going to happen.
About the ship's officers he cared less than
nothing; he was thinking now of the Arab
woman and her brown children below.  Abdullah
might or might not protect them from
the yellow fiends.
</p>

<p>
The tall figure of the serang rose at the
starboard ladder.  One glance from Li Fu told
Barnes that this was the end.  The two
lascars were here to finish the quartermaster, and
Gajah had come to attend to the second mate.
The time was at hand.
</p>

<p>
Barnes went to the door of the chart-house.
A shot would do the business, but he wanted
no shooting up here if possible.
</p>

<p>
"Serang!" he exclaimed crisply.  "Step
aft.  Something I want to show you."
</p>

<p>
That suited the Malay, who loosened his
kris in its sheath and followed.  At the
corner of the chart-house, Barnes pointed across
the deck, obscure in the starlight, to the boat.
</p>

<p>
"What's that?"
</p>

<p>
Sincerely astonished, Gajah peered at the
boat, with the two women sitting in her.  And
as he stared, Barnes let drive with the heavy
barrel of his automatic, a full, fair blow across
the skull.  A grunt broke from the serang,
who pitched sideways and flung out his arms.
Barnes caught him and lowered the bleeding
form to the deck, then darted back to the
chart-house.
</p>

<p>
Just in time, too!  For all his watchful
care, Li Fu had been taken unawares, one of
the lascars gripping him in both arms, the
other with kris upraised for the blow.  Barnes
was in upon them unseen, and struck down the
man with the kris.  The other lascar leaped
away, gained the far door of the chart-house&mdash;and
ran into the arms of Hi John.  Something
happened there.  Steel flashed and a
man gasped; the lascar slipped to the deck
quietly.
</p>

<p>
"You two men watch the ladders!" snapped
Barnes.  "When you hear me call, come
to the boat."
</p>

<p>
Revolvers out, each quartermaster took one
of the ladders.  Barnes turned and ran aft
along the deck at top speed, disregarding the
low call that the two women sent after him as
he passed the boat.  He was listening
desperately for sounds from below.  They came
to him, came all in a jumble that his brain
sorted out mechanically.  First came a
jarring wrench that shook the whole ship.  Then
the engines stopped.  Whatever Hi John had
done, the work was effective.  And at the
same instant the night was split by a sudden
cry.
</p>

<p>
"Allah!  Allah&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Then the screaming of the wireless man
was cut very short.  An oath of desperation on
his lips, Jim Barnes gained the small after
ladder that led to the stern of the main deck.
From below him burst a storm of cries; the
shriek of a woman, the staccato yells of men,
and a thin, shrill wail that maddened him.
He dropped to the deck below, and found
himself in the midst of an inferno, clearly
illumined by the deck-lights.
</p>

<p>
Abdullah lay across his water-pipe,
stabbed in the back.  Nearby was his eldest child,
also stabbed, and two lascars were fighting to
take another child from the arms of its dying
mother.  Barnes saw only this much, and then
began to fire.  He forgot everything but the
horror in front of him, and only laughed
when several of the lascars began to converge
on him.
</p>

<p>
A shot rang out from one of the forward
cabins.  Barnes, seizing the child, thrust him
up the ladder and then swung about to meet
three lascars plunging at him.  He shot the
first and second, ducked the kris-swing of the
third, then tripped the man and shot him as
he fell.  Then he plunged for the nearest
cabin, whence came screams.
</p>

<p>
Just what happened next is something of
which Jim Barnes never speaks.  The orders
of Lim Tock, to make a clean sweep of
Abdullah's family, were being followed to the
letter.  Barnes was in the cabin for fully a
minute&mdash;which, just then, was a very long
space of time.
</p>

<p>
By the time he emerged, much had happened.
There was a crashing and smashing
from the length of the cabins as the doors
were battered in.  From the bridge, a spatter
of revolver shots; and, from below, more shots
followed by the wild scream of the old chief
as he reached the deck&mdash;a scream of half rage,
half agony.  He died at the rail, trailing blood
across the deck, in his fist a blood-spattered
spanner.  After him, the Chinese stokers
poured up to the deck and scattered for loot.
</p>

<p>
Jim Barnes came out of the cabin, thrusting
a dead lascar ahead of him.  About his
neck clung one of Abdullah's daughters, and
under his left arm was another.  From the
passage leaped a stoker, whom Barnes shot.
Then, at the ladder, he urged the two little
girls upward to join their brother above.
</p>

<p>
A shot rang out at him, and the bullet
slithered on the steel beside him.  Barnes paused
to empty his automatics, then went up the
ladder on the jump.  At the top, he caught hold
of the frightened children and rushed them
along, shouting as he did so to the two
quartermasters.
</p>

<p>
They, after shooting at the forms down
below on the foredeck and in the well, joined
him at the boat.  Barnes chucked in the three
children and cast off the toggle.
</p>

<p>
"In with you, men, and lower away!  I'll
slide down the pendant.  Where's your pistol,
Ellen?  Hand it over&mdash;thanks.  Sit still,
all of you!  Lower, Li, lower!  That's it&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Li Fu slacked the lowering line about the
cleat, and the boat fell away rapidly.  Barely
in time, too; Barnes perceived a rush of
figures coming from the after ladder, and opened
fire.  They scattered.
</p>

<p>
There was a moment's breathing spell,
while from fore and aft, alow and aloft, rose
sing-song calls in Cantonese and the harsher
gutturals of the lascars.  A rush was being
planned from both sides.
</p>

<p>
Barnes caught a soft call from below, and
breathed a prayer of thanks.  A number of
figures showed at the corner of the
chart-house.  He emptied his pistol at these, then
turned, caught one of the pendants hitched to
the davit-head, and let himself go sliding
down.
</p>

<p>
A burst of yells rang out from the bridge
deck, but he was in the boat below ere any
could reach the rail.  The two quartermasters
had already put out the oars, and Barnes
cast off the line and let the pendants unreeve
as the roller whirled.  The boat started away
from the ship's side.
</p>

<p>
"Here," came a voice, and Barnes felt one
of his own pistols shoved into his hand.  "My
clip fitted your automatic and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Good girl, Ellen!" he cried out, and
laughed as he fired at the rail above.  A shot
made answer, and a kris sang through the air
to splash alongside&mdash;but the boat was clear.
She drew away from the ship before the
mutineers were sure just what had happened.
</p>

<h3>

</h3>

<p>
"There's one good thing we can say for
the <i>Sulu Queen</i>," observed Jim Barnes.
"That is, she sailed under English board
rules."
</p>

<p>
"What has that to do with our present
situation?" demanded Nora Sayers.
</p>

<p>
"It means that we've got a sprit rig stowed
aboard.  In oars, men!  Hi John, we'll be
sailing before the wind, so lash your oar to
the for'ard thwart to make a boom for the
fores'l.  Li Fu, break out the canvas.  Get
the mast stepped, then trim ship."
</p>

<p>
Over the waves behind, the tumult had died,
and the distant lights of the <i>Sulu Queen</i>
showed only when the boat lifted on a crest.
No pursuit had been made, nor had the
searchlight been put into effect.  Seemingly,
Lim Tock was making no effort to find the
boat.  Probably the supercargo was for the
present unable to get his men in hand and was
also very likely to be busy getting the engines
into working order.
</p>

<p>
When the centreboard was let down and the
boat was being trimmed, Jim Barnes surveyed
her with acute satisfaction.  She was a nearly
new whaleboat, fitted with a rudder in navy
style, and well found in all respects.  With a
grunt of delight, Barnes opened the oiled silk
wrapping of the matches, found the compass
to be a good one, and set it by his side in the
stern.  In another ten minutes the sprit was
up, the foresail rigged to the makeshift boom,
and the whaleboat was running before the
wind toward Borneo.
</p>

<p>
The eldest of the three children was barely
six; none of them were cognizant of what had
happened.  After whimpering a little, they
were soon asleep amidships, wrapped in the
spare sail.
</p>

<p>
"If you girls will come aft, you can curl
up in the bottom of the boat at my feet," said
Barnes.  "You'll be out of the wind and she'll
be better trimmed.  I've kept the boat well
wet down since we sailed, and she's dry as a
bone."
</p>

<p>
The two women obeyed.  Nora Sayers
looked up at Barnes.
</p>

<p>
"The other children?  And their mother?"
</p>

<p>
Barnes tried to speak, but his throat was
suddenly dry.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;damn it, girl, don't make me think of
it!  I did what I could.  Go to sleep."
</p>

<p>
Ellen Maggs caught her breath sharply.
Then, after a moment, Barnes felt her hand
touch his, and he gripped her fingers.  Both
women were crying, he thought; but after a
little they fell quiet, lulled by the regular rise
and fall of the boat, by the long forward
sweep, the rush and hiss of water as she drove
along on a crest, and the tilted drop into the
trough only to gather impetus anew and hurl
forward.
</p>

<p>
The curling sweep of wind and sea, like a
cleansing breath, wiped out all that was
behind them and lessened the sharp memory.
Once Barnes, looking back, saw a searchlight
fingering the water; that was all.  The stars
blazed cold and brilliant, and the thin
crescent of the new moon hung like green silver
against the depths above.  So passed the hours,
and the boat rushed ever onward and onward
under the steady sweep of wind.  Barnes held
her on the same course the <i>Sulu Queen</i> had
been following, to make the Bornean coast.
They were far out of any steamer track, and
there was no hope of being picked up unless
by some chance trading schooner.
</p>

<p>
Dawn found them steadily bowling along.
Li Fu had crept aft and relieved Barnes of
the tiller; and Barnes, resting against the
stern-thwart, opened his eyes to find the head
of Ellen Maggs pillowed upon his shirt, and
his arms about her shoulders.  How this had
come about, he had not the least idea, but
made no objection to the arrangement.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps aroused by his awakening stir, the
girl opened her eyes a moment later.  Nora
Sayers was sleeping peacefully.  Barnes felt
Ellen Maggs catch her breath at sight of the
ocean and sky that closed them in, then saw
the color come into her cheeks.  Before she
turned to glance at him, he closed his eyes
again.  She did not move, but, after realizing
the situation, accepted it.  Above them the
lean form of Li Fu crouched at the tiller,
dark eyes sweeping the water ahead.
</p>

<p>
"Awake?" asked Barnes after a moment.
"Don't move.  Sailing a whaleboat before
the wind, even with a centreboard, is about as
ticklish as canoeing.  Comfortable?"
</p>

<p>
"Very, thank you," she responded, although
he could see that the color lingered in her cheeks.
</p>

<p>
"When the kids wake up, we'll stretch our
legs a bit and break out some grub," said
Barnes.  She was silent for a space, then spoke
quietly.
</p>

<p>
"Are we going anywhere?  Have you seen
any ship, or will any see us?"
</p>

<p>
"Going to Borneo.  We'll raise the coast
as soon as the sun's up.  We won't see any
ship unless she sees us first, however."
</p>

<p>
"But I thought we might see one, and catch
her attention&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Jim Barnes chuckled at this.
</p>

<p>
"No chance!  Novels to the contrary, it
just ain't done.  A small boat has a horizon
of two and a half miles.  We could see
another boat a mile farther.  The bridge of a
ship can see us fifteen miles away, and would
be sure not to miss our sails.  So by the time
we saw a ship, she'd be bearing down to take
us on board.  But we'll not see any; we're
way out of the steamer lane."
</p>

<p>
Behind the boat, all the eastern sky
reddened and streamed with the dawn-shafts, and
the sun sprang suddenly from the sea-rim,
piercing the haze and mist of dawn with his
level rays of gold.  Li Fu bent down and
touched the shoulder of Barnes.  The latter
looked.  Out ahead of them a purple mass
was upheaved above the horizon, running
north and south.
</p>

<p>
"Look!"  Barnes pointed it out to the girl.
"There's Borneo.  If the wind holds, we'll
make the coast in a couple of hours.  The
wind's shifting around to the north, too.
Wake up, Hi John!  Take in your boom,
bring the sheet aft, and let the foresail gybe.
Mind your helm, Li Fu, as she wears&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The whaleboat came over nicely, but as
she heeled the three children wakened and
began to cry out.  Nora Sayers sat up, bewildered,
then quickly began to mother the little
ones.  Hi John came aft and relieved Li Fu,
who, with Barnes, set to work breaking out
the cabin stores put aboard the boat.
</p>

<p>
When breakfast was somewhat precariously
made an end of, Barnes turned over the
forward portion of the boat to the two women
and their charges, bringing the quartermasters
back in the stern with him.  With the
spare sail he contrived a low screen which
afforded the women some privacy without
lessening the windage of the sails.
</p>

<p>
Li Fu curled up to sleep, but Hi John, with
a serious effort to improve his English,
questioned Barnes about their course and then
delivered himself of a matter which drew
Barnes' immediate and earnest attention.
</p>

<p>
The quartermaster had discovered that the
captain had changed the course of the <i>Sulu
Queen</i> toward Borneo by reason of something
the serang Gajah had said to him.  Further,
he knew that there was much opium on the
steamer, which Lim Tock meant to transfer to
a junk which was to meet her somewhere.
Putting these facts together, the inference
was that the <i>Sulu Queen</i> was to meet the
junk somewhere near the mouth of the
Sesajap, for which the skipper had headed
her.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know but what you're right, John,"
said Barnes thoughtfully.  "We might run
into that junk, eh?  But no great matter if we
did.  They'd be Chinese and would leave us
alone."
</p>

<p>
Hi John shook his head at this.  The boat
was stenciled with the name of the <i>Sulu
Queen</i>, and the men aboard the junk would
not be exactly fools.  Barnes nodded assent.
</p>

<p>
"You're right.  Still, the chances are ten to
one that we'll not see her.  How badly did
you smash those engines?  What did you do
to them?"
</p>

<p>
"Me no savvy," said the quartermaster with
a shrug.  He had smashed them, and that was
all he knew, except that he had done it in a
hurry and at considerable risk.
</p>

<p>
Jim Barnes had fetched along no charts,
but needed none for this coast.  To the north
was Point Elphinstone and British territory,
and no settlements along the coast.  To the
south were several Dutch stations within a
hundred miles or so.  As Hi John claimed to
know the coast fairly well, Barnes decided to
run straight in for the land, if possible
identify their position, and then strike south for
the nearest Dutch settlement.  The boat was
staunch; the storm season was gone, and there
was nothing to fear.
</p>

<p>
"And the quicker I can get a gunboat after
that devil, Lim Tock, the better!" reflected
Barnes.  He still saw red at thought of what
he had witnessed the previous night.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
An hour passed, and another, and the coast
opened up before them as the breeze held.
The mountains of the interior rose in a dull
purple mass, against which stood the brighter
green of the low shores.  An island presently
detached itself to the north, and after studying
the coast-line carefully, Hi John declared
this to be Bunju, with the island of Tarakan
a little off the port bow.  South of Tarakan
were Dutch posts on the Bulangan River
mouths, so Barnes let her fill off a little,
heading southeast by east.
</p>

<p>
The children, meantime, had begun to explore,
and two of them appeared aft, staring
at the three men with wondering brown eyes,
but too shy to talk.  Barnes was paying little
heed to them; both he and Hi John were
examining the coast ahead.  Then, suddenly, Li
Fu uncurled, and came out of his sleep with a
blood-curdling yell.
</p>

<p>
For an instant Barnes thought the
quartermaster had gone mad, until he saw the man
staring at the wet leg of his dungaree
trousers.  Wet!  A chattering cry from Li Fu
drove the warning home.  He plunged forward.
</p>

<p>
"Drop it, you little rascal!  Drop it!"
</p>

<p>
It was one of those slight accidents upon
which destiny hangs and veers.  The Arab
boy had found the lanyard of the plug in the
boat's bottom, and now stood holding up the
plug curiously while the water spouted into
her.
</p>

<p>
At the cry and plunge of Barnes, the boy
scrambled away forward.  Nora Sayers came
aft, and ran into him.  They fell together,
just as Barnes flung himself on the plug and
attempted to replace it.  Hi John, too startled
to mind his helm properly, let her yaw on
the crest of a wave&mdash;and the big mainsail
gybed.
</p>

<p>
Barnes, who had jammed the plug back
into place, thought she was gone; but the
water that she had shipped saved her in that
instant.  The mast, bone-dry and rotten,
went with a rending crash, smashing the sprit
with it.  She swept up on the next sea with a
pile of canvas dragging over her bow and the
frightened children screaming.
</p>

<p>
Seizing Li Fu's knife, Barnes went into the
tangle furiously, for somewhere beneath it
was Ellen Maggs.  He found her unhurt,
however, her arms about the youngest child.
</p>

<p>
"Lord, girl!  I thought the mast had hit
you.  Get aft, now.  Both of you girls take
pannikins and bail.  Li, put out an oar and
keep her from broaching.  John, come along
and help clear away.  Move sharp, everybody!"
</p>

<p>
In five minutes the dripping canvas was
hauled in amidships and the damage
ascertained.  The sprit was gone beyond repair,
and the upper half of the mast.  Against the
stump, Barnes held an oar while Hi John
deftly lashed it in place.
</p>

<p>
"What happened?" demanded Nora Sayers.
</p>

<p>
"We all picked the lee side to fall on," and
Barnes laughed as he spoke.  "Cheer up!
No harm done!  We'll run into shore and
replace the spars, then be on our way.  Eh,
John?"
</p>

<p>
"Can do," grunted Hi John, examining the
coast line.  "Plenty bamboo.  Hey!  Catchum
sail off sta'board counter!"
</p>

<p>
Barnes leaped to a thwart and took one look
to the north.  A brown, square sail was in
sight, creeping from behind one of the islands.
</p>

<p>
He turned.
</p>

<p>
"Now, John, move!  Get that canvas up,
anyway at all so it'll draw&mdash;come on!  Use
that long piece of the sprit for a gaff; lash the
canvas to it and then lash it as high on the
oar as you can.  Look alive!  That's your
junk, yonder."
</p>

<p>
The two men fell furiously to work, while
the women bailed and Li Fu tugged at the
long oar to keep the whaleboat from broaching.
And the brownish yellow matting sail
crept down on them like an ungainly water-spider.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap05"></a></p>

<h3>
V
</h3>

<p>
Under the rapid directions of Barnes,
the whaleboat was presently surging
through the water again, while he took the
tiller and the quartermasters finished the
bailing.  Both women sat a bit aft to trim the
boat anew; and, as they had worked diligently
at Cantonese while fitting themselves for
mission duties, they understood the tongue more
or less.  Neither of the quartermasters was
aware of the fact.  Barnes spoke it not at all.
</p>

<p>
"Our master is in love with this drooping
girl," said Li Fu chantingly, as he bailed.
"Lim Tock desired her also.  She must have
a devil that charms some men, for she is of no
beauty in my eyes."
</p>

<p>
Hi John laughed harshly.  "If those aboard
the junk see the women, they will try hard for
us!  Lim Tock was a Straits man; to him
white women are beautiful.  These others are
Straits men, too, I think.  Women are more
desirable than gold, and white women than
pearls; for white women are hard to come by
in Singapore, unless one&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He went on to speak learnedly of matters
which, by good fortune, came in words that
the two women had not learned.  As it was,
they gave each other a startled glance.  Then
Ellen Maggs motioned to the spare sail.
</p>

<p>
"Get it, Nora.  Lie down and pull it over us."
</p>

<p>
Barnes saw the action, and his eyes
narrowed perplexedly.  Then he understood,
and a smile touched his lips.
</p>

<p>
"Good work, girls!  Get the kids with you.
Li and John, lie down here by the after
thwart, in the trough of the next wave.
Chances are they won't have very good
glasses aboard the junk.  We'll puzzle 'em a
bit and make 'em suspicious."
</p>

<p>
Once again the slender accident upon
which hangs fortune!  Although the junk
was at least three miles from them, Barnes
had swiftly estimated her course and sailing
power, and had come to the desperate
conclusion that she meant to intercept them and
would do so before they could make the shore.
Her large forward and smaller after sail were
putting her through the water almost dead
before the wind at a fast clip.
</p>

<p>
Now, when the whaleboat rose to the following
seas, she presented the spectacle of a
boat under jury rig manned by a single figure
in the stern.  Other figures had been aboard
her; now they were gone.  To those on the
junk, familiar with the artifices of Malay and
Dyak, familiar with theft and murder and
piracy by quiet lagoon and hidden river-mouth,
it was obvious that the thirty-foot
whaleboat wished them to think only one
person was aboard.  The others might be lying
hidden with weapons ready under mats and
sails&mdash;as they were.
</p>

<p>
Jim Barnes hauled in his sheets until the
whaleboat began to heel, and headed up more
directly For the shore, sailing by the wind and
getting every possible fraction of speed out of
her.  Watching narrowly, he saw the brown
matting sail braced around.  The junk altered
her course slightly, to run past the stern
of the whaleboat and reconnoitre.
</p>

<p>
"Good!" he exclaimed, with a breath of
relief.  "We've won&mdash;he's frightened!
Everybody stay close, now.  We don't want her
to learn too much.  Li Fu, feel around there
and pass me up the crutch for the steering oar,
and you, John, have one of the oars ready.
I'll ship the crutch and get out the oar.
That'll give us better steering power and add
a bit to our speed.  We'll need the oar in the
surf, if there is any."
</p>

<p>
Five minutes later the change was made
and Barnes stood up to the long oar, which
kept the boat from yawing and thus aided her
progress.  Her makeshift rig was holding
and promised to effect its purpose.
</p>

<p>
So it did, indeed.  Another twenty minutes
made so plain to the junk that the whaleboat
could not be intercepted, that she hauled
about and stood off-shore, giving up the chase
entirely.  Barnes jubilantly conveyed the
news to all hands, but added a warning
word.
</p>

<p>
"Stay where you are!  We don't want her
coming in later to investigate us.  John, stand
by the centreboard and haul up when I give
the word.  There's a lagoon ahead, and we
may find a bar at the entrance.  No sign of
any, but that don't always signify&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He craned anxiously forward as he stood,
examining the shores upon which they were
sweeping.  They were low and unhealthy.
From the water ascended a line, a tangled
cluster of mangrove roots twisted like frozen
snakes, with the green wall above.  Here and
there, however, openings showed that behind
these islets lay long lagoons.  For one of these
openings Barnes steered, forced to take
chances on striking a sandbar.  He looked back
from a crest and found the brown sail dipping
under the horizon.
</p>

<p>
"All clear!  Come alive!  Ready for a
shock if she strikes, girls.  Haul in, John!
That's the ticket!"
</p>

<p>
In between the trees, they rushed on a white
foam-crest, swept past, and went darting
across the quiet surface of a lagoon, the sails
flapping.  A hundred yards in width it was,
the mangrove wall on one side, and on the
other a strip of white sand with jungle
greenery making another wall to shut off the sky.
The boat glided gently across and drifted
until her nose touched the sand.  With a breath
of relief, Barnes dropped his oar.
</p>

<p>
Then the heat smote them, blazing, torrential,
insufferable.  There in the quiet lagoon,
cut off from wind and sea, the sun beat down
unchecked.  Nora Sayers, coming to her feet,
glanced at the watch on her wrist and uttered
a cry of surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Good gracious!  Do you know that it's
nearly noon?  No wonder it's hot&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Sit down!" ordered Barnes.  "Pull her
up, lads."
</p>

<p>
Leaping into the water, the quartermasters
pulled the nose of the whaleboat to the sand
and helped the two women and the children
out.
</p>

<p>
"All ashore!" sang out Barnes.  "Li Fu,
you and John cut a new mast and sprit.
Bamboo, if you can find it; if not, whatever you
can get.  Miss Sayers, keep your eye on the
kids, will you?  Miss&mdash;er&mdash;Ellen, will you
take this stuff as I hand it out?  We'll use the
spare canvas for table-cloth, and have a
bang-up feed to celebrate.  You girls are getting
your money's worth this cruise!  How do
you like Borneo?"
</p>

<p>
Nora Sayers had no time to answer, for
the three brown children had promptly
stripped and were plunging through the
water or catching sand-fleas, and she was
in laughing pursuit.  Ellen Maggs smiled as
she took the provisions that Barnes handed
out.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;why, I like it!" she said, her eyes big
with wonder at the things around, and
sparkling with eagerness.  "I'm frightened, and
happy, and&mdash;don't want to go back!  Are
there any savages around?"
</p>

<p>
"Probably a few head-hunters, but they
won't worry us.  Here's a tin of sardines."
</p>

<p>
With her next load the girl was laughing
at sight of Nora Sayers rounding up her
charges.
</p>

<p>
"I wish we could do that, too!  The water
looks so clean, and the sand so white."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing to prevent," said Barnes, chuckling.
"After lunch we'll get the boat rigged.
You and Nora can slip up around that point,
take the kids along and enjoy life.  No sharks
of any size in here, and no crocodiles in salt
water, I guess.  You might catch a stingaree,
but not much chance.  While you're gone,
I'll have a dip myself."
</p>

<p>
Nora Sayers and the excited, chattering
brown children rejoined them, and presently
their noon meal was ready.  Barnes sent up a
call, which was answered from the depths of
the green jungle, but the meal was half over
when Li Fu and Hi John appeared.  They
were hot and bedraggled, but exultantly
produced two admirable spars of bamboo, each
of the right size, for mast and sprit.
</p>

<p>
Nora Sayers, energetic and vigorous despite
the heat, went exploring and announced the
discovery of a little cove, just around a sandy
point.  So, taking the children, she and Ellen
Maggs presently departed thither, and the
joyful shrieks of splashing youngsters soon
echoed through the lagoon.
</p>

<p>
Jim Barnes lighted his pipe and fell to
work on the spars, at which the quartermasters
joined him after their meal.  It was no
light job, since he was determined to have
everything shipshape for the proper handling
of the boat, and the sheath-knives made slow
work of the fibrous bamboo.  It was an hour
before the mast was stepped and rigged to his
satisfaction.  Then he enjoyed a quick dip,
and was dressed again when the others
returned.  The Chinese went in search of crabs,
to vary their diet.
</p>

<p>
The two women found Barnes sitting on the
sand, his pipe alight and a frown on his face,
as he studied the opposite shore of the lagoon.
</p>

<p>
"Are you all ready to get off?" asked Nora.
</p>

<p>
"Ready and waiting."  Barnes grinned
cheerfully.  "Look at the channel over there,
by which we came in.  Notice anything funny
about it?"
</p>

<p>
Both women looked, perplexed, but could
find no explanation of his words.  Barnes
pointed to the sand about the bow of the boat.
</p>

<p>
"There's the answer, girls.  Tide!  It must
have been on the ebb when we got here.  Now
she's gone down, and there isn't three inches
of water over the bar.  We're stuck until
about five o'clock, that's all!  I'm taking no
chances with a thin-skinned whaleboat."
</p>

<p>
"We can't get out, then?" queried Ellen
Maggs.
</p>

<p>
"Right.  We can fish and sew and smoke
and talk, and hunt crabs, but we can't leave.
By four or five o'clock we may scrape over.
Why worry?  We're a lot better off than we
might have been.  Not often you strike a
sand beach along these mangrove swamps, I
can tell you!  We'll stretch the spare sail as
an awning for the kids and let 'em sleep."
</p>

<p>
Using the broken spars, and Nora Sayers
aiding him, he stretched the canvas from the
side of the boat and the three children were
soon asleep in the shade.  Retiring to the edge
of the trees, the three awaited the return of
the quartermasters.  Barnes sighed luxuriously.
</p>

<p>
"Golly!  This is the first vacation I've had
in a long while.  Hope you girls won't lose
your jobs if you don't get back to China on
schedule?"
</p>

<p>
"I guess not," said Ellen Maggs.  "What
brought you on that awful ship, Mr. Barnes?"
</p>

<p>
Barnes gave her a look of whimsical reproach.
</p>

<p>
"Now, now, I'm surprised at you!  My
name isn't Mister&mdash;it's Jim!  Make believe
we're on a desert isle, can't you?"
</p>

<p>
Ellen Maggs blushed faintly, but her eyes
were sparkling when she responded.
</p>

<p>
"All right&mdash;Jim!  Now what brought you
on that ship?"
</p>

<p>
"Fate," said Jim Barnes, grinning.  "Do
you girls remember that morning you came
into the consul's office in Hong Kong?"
</p>

<p>
Both women glanced at him, surprised.
</p>

<p>
"Were you there?" demanded Nora Sayers.
"We didn't see you?".
</p>

<p>
"I was there when you left, after talking
with the consul about the <i>Sulu Queen</i>" he
responded.  "You were too excited to notice
me, though.  The consul's a good sport.  He
knew the old hooker was no ship for me, but
he said you girls were stubborn and were
going to take the trip aboard her&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The rates," put in Ellen Maggs meekly,
"were half what the other steamers wanted."
</p>

<p>
"Sure.  So's the pay they offered me.  'You
go along on that houseboat of corruption,
Barnes,' the consul said.  'She needs a second,
and there ought to be one white man aboard
her if those fool girls are determined to sail.'  So,
having seen you girls, I agreed with him&mdash;and
here we are!  And believe me, I'm tickled
to death that I shipped aboard her."
</p>

<p>
"So am I," said Nora Sayers laughing
frankly.  Ellen Maggs said nothing at all,
but Barnes caught a look from her eyes that
set his pulses leaping.
</p>

<p>
Li Fu and Hi John returned with a mighty
loot of crabs and sea-slugs garnered from the
outer reef, and reported that no sail was in
sight, nor was any trail of smoke along the
horizon.  While the women shudderingly
eyed the hideous slugs and the children poked
at them with sticks, Barnes got a fire going
from dry driftwood and the crab-meat was
cooked.  The two Chinese squatted over
another fire and prepared the slugs after their
own fashion.
</p>

<p>
The repast was flavored with curiosity
rather than hunger.  By the time it was done,
Nora Sayers announced the hour as nearly
four.  Jim Barnes glanced out at the bar, and
nodded.  The tide was creeping in.
</p>

<p>
"All aboard!  We'll try it, anyhow.  Unship
the tiller, Li!  She steers and handles
much better with the oar."
</p>

<p>
Thankful to escape from the unstirred,
stagnant heat of the lagoon, the women and
children were aided into the boat after it had
been shoved clear.  Barnes took the stern; the
quartermasters ran her out and leaped aboard,
getting out oars.
</p>

<p>
"Wind's going down outside," announced
Barnes, as they neared the opening.  "We'll
keep along the coast during the night,
however, and with morning ought to run into some
native fishing boats.  We can soon find where
the nearest Dutch post is located.  Here we
are, now!  In oars, men!  Stand by the
centreboard, John.  Li Fu, take care of the
sheets!"
</p>

<p>
The boat's keel touched the mud of the bar
lightly, very lightly, and then was over.
There had been surf in the morning, but now
it was gone, except for a line of breakers fifty
feet away.  The sails caught the breeze, the
boat heeled over, and a moment later Barnes
luffed and drove her through the surf, to fall
away on the other tack and head out to the
southward.
</p>

<p>
Then, as he stood watching the sails, his
eyes widened.  Before him, seemingly without
cause, had appeared a little round hole in
the mainsail.  An instant later the crack of a
rifle came on the wind.  He turned, as a shout
broke from Li Fu, and perceived what none
of them had observed in the moment of
getting through the surf.
</p>

<p>
Half a mile to the north along the
mangrove reef was the same junk they had
encountered earlier in the day; and, between her
and them, bearing down upon them and booming
along with the breeze, were three ship's
boats with canvas set.
</p>

<p>
"Our boats!" cried Jim Barnes.  "They
sank the ship and came along in the boats.
Down, everybody!  John, get those water
breakers aft to trim ship.  Down!"
</p>

<p>
Another rifle-crack emphasized his words,
and then the sharp song of the bullet whining
overhead, followed by a chorus of yells from
the three boats.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap06"></a></p>

<h3>
VI
</h3>

<p>
Barnes stood at the steering oar, holding
the long ash deep and giving the whaleboat
every ounce of windage that would drive
her forward.  Shot after shot rang out from
the pursuing boats, which were filled with
men.
</p>

<p>
He could picture well enough what had
happened.  Lim Tock, unable to repair the
smashed engines of the <i>Sulu Queen</i>, had sunk
her.  Into the boats had piled the lascars and
the yellow men, with their loot and opium,
and started for the coast.  They must have
met the junk during the day, put the loot
aboard her, heard of the whaleboat, and had
come to seek her.  Lim Tock would not dare
to let her escape to carry tales.
</p>

<p>
"And now they've found us right enough!"
he thought.  "Caught us, confound it!  If
they didn't have rifles, I'd run out to sea and
fight 'em with seamanship.  Those lascars
can't begin to handle whaleboats.  If we only
had a good mile between us!  But the wind's
falling.  It'll die out, and won't come up
again until after sunset.  And by that time
they'll crawl up on us with the oars.  Damn it!"
</p>

<p>
The bullets droned overhead.  One man at
a time seemed to be firing until his magazine
emptied.  There were good shots among the
pursuers, too; several holes were visible in the
mainsail, and twice Barnes had felt hot lead
come close.  It dawned upon him that they
were firing at his figure.
</p>

<p>
"Are we beating them?" called Nora Sayers.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Barnes grimly.  In his appraisal
he found the case hopeless, desperate;
and he put it bluntly enough, explaining that
the oarsmen aboard the pursuing boats, and
the calm that was certain to fall, insured
their being overtaken.  The Chinese listened
calmly, with clear understanding; the two
women comprehending well enough, but
urging him desperately with their eyes.
</p>

<p>
The whaleboat was reaching out on the
starboard tack, as she had left the lagoon
opening.  The land fell away to the southwest,
so that she was standing practically out
to sea while running almost before the wind.
</p>

<p>
"We'll have to run for the land, and do it
quick," said Barnes.  "We don't dare to tack;
we'll have to wear.  The breeze is still pretty
fresh, and they're apparently badly out of
trim; good!  Now you'll see some fun, girls.
I'll bet a trade dollar that one of 'em gets
spilled.  Nora, come a bit aft and sit on the
lee thwart&mdash;that's right.  Revolvers loaded, men?"
</p>

<p>
The quartermasters answered with a nod.
Barnes commanded Li Fu to stand by the fore
sheet and, when the helm was put up, to empty
his weapon at the nearest of the three boats.
</p>

<p>
"You take charge of the main sheet, John.
Those lascars will imitate us, and we'll give
'em something to imitate, or I'm a Dutchman!
All right, John&mdash;slack away, roundly!  Haul
in&mdash;haul in!  Let her gybe, now&mdash;smart does
it!  Ease away, now&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The staccato reports of Li Fu's revolver
cracked emptily down the wind.  The boat
went off before the wind, and the mainsail was
hauled in and gybed dangerously, then was
eased away as she paid off on the new tack.
Li Fu, dropping his weapon, handled the fore
sheet smartly to meet her by the wind.
</p>

<p>
A jubilant yell broke from Barnes as he
glanced backward.  The foremost pursuer,
confused by Li Fu's bullets, tried to wear
hastily and suddenly.  Her mainsail hauled
around in a terrific jibe that sent her flat over.
Heads dotted the water about the craft, but
the other two boats managed the trick safely
and stood away without halting to pick
up their companions.  A renewed rifle-fire
opened from them.
</p>

<p>
"Fire and be damned to you!" shouted
Barnes in delight.  "If I had you out at sea
and the wind steady, I'd show you tricks, you
dogs!  That's one of you gone, and the junk
will be delayed picking up&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The words seemed suddenly checked on his
lips; a grunt broke from him, an abrupt
ejaculation of surprise and almost alarm.  The
occasion of it did not appear.
</p>

<p>
"Can either of you men steer with the oar?"
he demanded.
</p>

<p>
Li Fu shook his head.  Hi John assented
with a nod, and Barnes beckoned him.
Picking his way aft, Hi John took over the oar.
</p>

<p>
"You see that point dead ahead, with what
seems to be a river-mouth on the other side?
Head for it, or a couple of points to starboard
of it to allow for leeway.  And make the
river, John&mdash;good man&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Barnes spoke jerkily.  For an instant he
changed countenance; an expression of agony
leaped across his face.  He started forward.
A cry broke from Ellen Maggs.
</p>

<p>
"Catch him, Li Fu!"
</p>

<p>
But Jim Barnes sank down on the thwart
beside Nora Sayers, and, smiling a little,
reached up one of his automatics to Li Fu.
</p>

<p>
"Here, Li!  Go aft to keep her trimmed,
and let 'em have it.  Fire low; those bullets
will smash through the boat."
</p>

<p>
Li Fu stepped past him.  Barnes, disregarding
the hand of Nora Sayers, lifted himself
forward a little and dropped near the bow
thwart, beside Ellen Maggs.  The three
children were up in the bow, chattering away and
delighted with the chase.
</p>

<p>
"You're hurt?" cried Ellen Maggs, leaning
toward Barnes.  He laughed lightly, though
his lips were graying, as he looked into her
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Aye.  Nora, pass up that little black medicine
chest, will you?  It's stowed under your
thwart, I think, with the lantern and other
stuff that was in the boat.  Does either of you
girls know anything about surgery?"
</p>

<p>
"I do," said Ellen Maggs.  Her cheeks
were very white, her eyes large.  "Only a
little&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Barnes put his hand under his shirt and
examined his side gingerly.  Then, with a
grimace, he wriggled out of his jacket.  He took
the sheath-knife which Li Fu tossed forward
on demand, and cut at the right side of his
shirt.  Nora Sayers, her face drawn and
anxious, would have come with the medicine case,
but Barnes checked her.
</p>

<p>
"Stay where you are, Nora.  We're fighting
to reach land ahead of those devils, and
every bit of trim to the boat counts a lot.
Throw it; that's right.  Now Ellen, the
bullet went in under the right arm and is
bulging out the skin here on my right side.  Cut
the skin and it'll pop out.  I'm not left-handed
or I could do it.  Then douse on
plenty of iodine fore and aft, and clap on some
kind of a bandage."
</p>

<p>
He lay back and threw up his arms, gripping
the corks outside the gunwale, and so lay
motionless, waiting.  The girl leaned forward,
her lips clenched.
</p>

<p>
"Don't worry; it won't hurt," he said easily.
"You, Li Fu!  Open up.  Are they gaining
on us, or holding steady?"
</p>

<p>
"Plenty steady," responded the quartermaster.
At the next wave-crest he fired.
</p>

<p>
His feet braced, Barnes lay motionless, and
a smile crept to his pallid lips as he noted the
deft certainty with which the girl attacked
her task.  Twice she started to cut, and
flinched; then, desperately, she set the keen
steel to the white skin.  In five seconds it was
done.  The bullet fell from her reddened
fingers and bounced on the thin sheathing.
</p>

<p>
"Steady, steady!" said Barnes quietly,
seeing her lips quiver.  "Now the smelly stuff
and the bandages, girl."  A sudden exclamation
from the Chinese made him glance up.
"What is it, men?  What is it?"
</p>

<p>
"That last shot plenty damn good; first-chop!"
responded Li Fu, staring out.  "Hai!
Catchum bottomside one time!"
</p>

<p>
"Fine work!" cried Barnes.  "That's two
out of the race.  Ripped through her
sheathing, eh?  Anybody hurt?"
</p>

<p>
"My no can see&mdash;catchum one damn coolie,
mebbeso.  Bail like hellee!"
</p>

<p>
"Good!  Do the same to the other boat if
you can."
</p>

<p>
"Can do," asserted Li Fu confidently, but
he failed to make good his promise.  The one
shot that caused one of the two pursuers to
limp behind was doubtless sheer luck.
</p>

<p>
"Turn over, please," came the voice of
Ellen Maggs.
</p>

<p>
Barnes obeyed.  The girl caught her breath
as his blood-soaked back was revealed, while
Nora Sayers leaned forward and directed her,
aiding as best she could.
</p>

<p>
"How's the wind?" demanded Barnes,
while the bandage was being wrapped in
place.
</p>

<p>
"Go down plenty quick," responded Li Fu,
examining the empty weapon.  "No can do.
I think Lim Tock in this boat.  Plenty joss."
</p>

<p>
"Huh!  Joss won't save him if I get a good
crack at the devil," commented Barnes, as he
lay face-down.  "Going to make the river,
John?"
</p>

<p>
"Aye.  Can do."
</p>

<p>
"It's done," said Ellen Maggs, her voice
very faint.
</p>

<p>
Barnes lifted himself stiffly and sat up.  He
saw the girl smile tremulously.  Then her
face went ashen and she dropped back against
the lee gunwale and lay quiet.  Barnes looked
up at Nora Sayers.
</p>

<p>
"Leave her be," he said quietly.  "Poor
girl!  Must have been hell for her."
</p>

<p>
"It was," agreed Nora Sayers, regarding
him almost savagely.  "Why didn't you let
me do it?  She wasn't made for that sort of
thing, although she's a wonderful surgical
assistant.  I saw her faint twice, one morning
at Tientsin, when they were working on the
wounded men.  She ought to be cooking and
tending babies, instead of messing around
blood and wounds!"
</p>

<p>
"Good lord, don't take it out on me!" said
Barnes, and smiled a little.  "I didn't send
her out to China, did I?  But it won't be my
fault if she ever goes back, I can tell you that!
Come on, swap places with me and mother
her a bit.  I've got to see what's doing.  We've
got a darned slim chance even if we do get
ashore, and we can't overlook any bets."
</p>

<p>
He dragged himself painfully to the thwart,
Nora Sayers aiding him.  Then, as he sat up,
she took the head of Ellen Maggs in her lap.
</p>

<p>
To his infinite relief, Barnes perceived that
they were more than holding their own in the
chase, and, if the wind had held, might have
run for it successfully.  But the wind would
not hold.  Already it was dying out.  Looking
back, he could see the brown matting sails
of the junk flapping idly as she lay to,
picking up the men from the capsized boat.  The
second boat, half submerged, was heading
back for her.
</p>

<p>
Only the third boat held on its course.  As
nearly as Barnes could tell, there were a dozen
men aboard her, but without glasses he could
not distinguish figures to the extent of
identifying them.  He took the empty weapon from
Li Fu and began to reload.
</p>

<p>
"None too many cartridges left; we didn't
figure on a little war," he commented, and
turned his attention to the shore.
</p>

<p>
A breath of relief escaped him.  The shore
was a scant quarter-mile away, and the wind
would get them to it.  Hi John had made the
promontory, a low, mangrove-rimmed tongue
of land, and was heading toward the
river-mouth which had disclosed itself beyond.
The stream was one of some size, thickly girt
by trees and jungle.
</p>

<p>
A single line of surf, breaking across the
bar, was divided by a small, narrow island of
white sand, where a few trees struggled.  With
extra high tides the island would be covered,
Barnes decided, but not at present.
</p>

<p>
"Right-hand channel, John," he directed.
"Then beach her on that island.  If we don't
get that boat stopped, she'll do for us; but we
can stop her.  Ellen waked up yet?"
</p>

<p>
"Not yet," said Nora Sayers.
</p>

<p>
"Then leave her alone.  The next ten minutes
tells the tale.  Give me that gun of hers."
</p>

<p>
The girl obeyed.  A shrill cry from Hi
John heralded the surf-line, and as the boat
rose to it, the sail began to flap.  The wind
was down.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
VII
</h3>

<p>
Sunset was at hand.  The red ball of the
sun, blurred out of rotundity by the haze,
hovered at the purple rim of the western
mountains as though hesitating to depart.
</p>

<p>
The boat was through the surf, carried forward
by the white crest in a surging rush.  A
last puff of wind filled her sails and gave her
way enough to get over the bar and go in upon
the sandy shore of the islet.  Here the trees
and brush, while nothing like the tangled
mass of jungle ashore, were thick enough to
afford concealment.  This was not the aim of
Barnes, however.
</p>

<p>
"Haul her up, lads!"  To his order the
quartermasters leaped out.  "You girls stay
here and keep the kids quiet.  If they have
the nerve to rush, we're gone; but they won't.
Here, John, give me a hand!  Quick!"
</p>

<p>
He was helped ashore, finding himself very
weak but clear-headed.  Each of the Chinese
had a revolver.  Barnes had two automatics
and the one belonging to Ellen.  He gave his
directions swiftly, and the two men darted
into the brush.  Barnes leaned against the
nearest tree and waited, watching the canvas
of the pursuing boat come flying in with the
last dregs of the breeze.
</p>

<p>
At last she came, rising on the gathering
surge of the breaking surf, bow flinging high,
steersman standing at the straining, oar in the
stern.  As she lifted against the flaming sky,
Barnes threw up his automatic and fired.  The
oarsman crumpled up.  From three points
the islet spat bullets at the nearing boat,
sweeping her with the hot lead.
</p>

<p>
By some miracle, the expected did not
happen.  Instead of capsizing, the boat swept in
on the surf, and paused.  A rifle spat
response vainly.  Men were tumbling, falling
over the thwarts, shrieking and yelling oaths.
The figure of Lim Tock, in the bow,
staggered and went down, but his voice pierced
through the din continually.
</p>

<p>
An oar was put out, and another.  Of the
dozen men aboard her, not half survived that
blasting welcome.  Revolvers and pistols had
been emptied.  Frantically the gasping men
got the boat headed around to meet the surf.
Two more oars jabbed out.  Barnes lifted
Ellen Maggs' pistol and shot with deliberate
aim.  Two of the oarsmen sprawled down.
Somehow the boat crawled out again, in an
interval of the surf, and began to draw away.
Barnes, disappointed and raging, emptied his
last bullets at her.  For a while she floated
there, until the oars bit at the water and
pulled her slowly away.
</p>

<p>
"Damn it!" said Barnes bitterly, as the
quartermasters came back, reloading.  "Came
within an ace of capsizing him; came within
an ace of getting him and bagging his rifles!
And missed.  Now we've lost the whole trick
after all."
</p>

<p>
"Plenty joss along Lim Tock," commented Hi John.
</p>

<p>
Barnes wearily turned to the boat and
seated himself on the gunwale, while at his
order the two men unshipped the spars and
canvas.  Ellen Maggs still lay unconscious,
her head in the lap of Nora Sayers, who, was
looking up at Barnes with glad eyes.
</p>

<p>
"We've won?  You beat them off?"
</p>

<p>
Barnes mechanically felt for his pipe, filled
it, and held a match to it.
</p>

<p>
"No," he said, his voice bitter.  "We'd
have won if we'd got their rifles and killed
that devil, Lim Tock.  We only drove him
off&mdash;and we've lost, absolutely.  Leave the
spars here ashore, John; put the canvas
aboard&mdash;that's right.  Lay her on the
canvas, Nora, and take it easy.  You'll need the
sails for a covering against the night-mist."
</p>

<p>
When she had made the unconscious girl
comfortable with the canvas, Nora Sayers
rose and stepped ashore, where the three
children were already ranging happily.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" she demanded.
"How have we lost?"
</p>

<p>
Barnes jerked his pipe to seaward.
</p>

<p>
"They're bound to silence us at all costs,
aren't they?  Sure.  They've plenty of men
aboard the junk and those other boats.  It'll
probably remain calm until sunrise, now, and
we can't possibly get to sea.  We can use only
two oars.  The inference is obvious."
</p>

<p>
She could not mistake it, and nodded slowly.
Barnes turned to the two Chinese.
</p>

<p>
"Any idea where we are, John?"
</p>

<p>
Hi John nodded, and squatted in the sand
with a stick.  In the sand he drew several
converging lines, designed to represent the
delta and mouths of a large river.  He pointed
to one, then indicated the river beside them.
</p>

<p>
"I think Bulungan River," he said.  "We
go up, bimeby we come topside.  Big river."
</p>

<p>
"You may be right, John&mdash;and look here!
There's a Dutch post somewhere up the
Bulungan&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Two," said the quartermaster.  "Plenty
big river, topside."
</p>

<p>
Barnes looked at the recumbent figure of
Ellen Maggs in the boat, looked at the three
children playing in the sand.  In the warm,
clear light of the sunset, the perplexed frown
of his face was plain to be seen.  He looked
anxious, yet his blue eyes were stormy and
filled with a passionate anger as though he
were rebelling against something that he saw
was unavoidable.  He came to his feet and
paused.
</p>

<p>
"Dutch posts?" cried Nora Sayers eagerly.
"Then we can row up the river!"
</p>

<p>
Barnes looked at her, and under the regard
of his eyes she fell silent.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you can," he said.  "Sure.  And so
can those devils, unless there's something right
here to stop 'em!  Besides, it's a long chance.
We don't know for sure that it's the Bulungan
River, or one of the mouths.  That's the devil
of destiny; it never gives a man a fair show
for his white alley!  The cards are stacked
every time."
</p>

<p>
He glanced at the sky.  There was yet half
an hour of daylight, for the sun was down
behind the western mountains of Borneo, and
the afterglow would linger for a while.
</p>

<p>
"You mean," questioned the girl, "that they
can row so much faster than we can?"
</p>

<p>
"Exactly.  A dozen oars to our two.  The
Dutch posts, if they're here, are probably
miles up-river.  They are trading posts, you
know, in touch with the natives.  We might
hide somewhere along the river, only to die
slowly.  Lim Tock will search every inch of
the stream, you may be sure.  His own life
depends on it."
</p>

<p>
"If we could get a messenger up the river&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Barnes, and laughed.  Nora
Sayers bit her lip.
</p>

<p>
For a moment he puffed at his pipe, then
drew a deep breath and beckoned the two
quartermasters.  They came, watching his
face calmly, without emotion.
</p>

<p>
"You men will take this boat and row up
the stream," he said quietly.  "I confide to
your care these two women, and these
children.  You are to protect them at all costs.
This is&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;wait!" exclaimed Nora Sayers in dismay.
</p>

<p>
"Shut up!" snapped Barnes.  "Now, men,
this is your duty.  They must be taken up to
the Dutch post, wherever it is.  It means you
must row most of the night, understand?  I
shall remain here and stop Lim Tock's men.
I'm no good for rowing&mdash;and I can do that.
Now, do you understand?"
</p>

<p>
"My savvy.  Aye," they responded together.
</p>

<p>
"Good.  Get to work and lighten the boat,
then."
</p>

<p>
Barnes put his pipe between his teeth and
stepped toward the trees.  He found himself
halted, the girl's hand on his arm.  He
turned, and was astonished by the emotion
that was in her face and eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Please!" she said brokenly.  "You must
not do this.  You must not deliberately
sacrifice yourself&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Cut it out, will you?" he roughly
intervened.  "I know what must be done here,
Nora.  I'm not making any grandstand play,
either.  I can hold 'em up, and you can send
down a Dutch launch with a gun in her.
They have 'em with machine-guns and pom-poms.
One o' their launches could sink that
blamed junk in a jiffy!  They'll come quick
enough, too!  Believe me, those Dutchmen
like nothing better than wiping out pirates,
unless it's wiping out plague-ships.  They do
both jobs up brown."
</p>

<p>
"Stop evading, please," she broke in.
"Why are you doing this?  Why don't you
leave one of those Chinese here, and go with
us?"
</p>

<p>
The face of Barnes twisted wryly.
</p>

<p>
"Gosh, I wish that I could!" he said almost
wistfully.  "Nope.  Whoever stays here will
have a sweet time of it.  Besides, I'm good
for nothing else.  Those quartermasters are
darned fine men, Nora; they'll see you
through safe.  You've got to realize that
we're up against a desperate affair, and no
half-way measures will serve!"
</p>

<p>
She stared into his eyes for a moment.
</p>

<p>
"Is it for the children that you're doing
it?" she asked.  "They aren't worth it, I tell
you!  Three Arab children&mdash;they aren't
worth the loss of a man like you!"
</p>

<p>
"You know better, girl," he said quietly,
and she shivered.
</p>

<p>
"Is it&mdash;us?  Is it for her?  Then, do you
think she'd want to leave you?  Do you think
she'd want to live and know that you had died
here&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Shut up; you'll be hysterical if you keep
up this gait," interrupted Barnes.  "Now,
young lady, you can gamble good and hard
that I don't want to stay here!  Not much.
If there was any way out of it, I wouldn't.
I'm not hankering for a martyr's crown or
any of that hero stuff, not for a minute!  I'm
for keeping Jim Barnes topside every time.
It hurts like hell to realize that there's no
other way out.  But here are you girls, and
the kids, and somebody has to wait here.  See?
It just has to be done, that's all."
</p>

<p>
"Then&mdash;then you don't believe that&mdash;we
can reach the post in time?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, anything's possible," said Barnes
dryly.  "Sure, there's a chance!  Now, I
want you to get off before Ellen wakes up,
see?  Let her sleep as long as she will; this
faint of hers is liable to go into sleep."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Meantime, the two quartermasters, while
lightening the boat of everything except food
and a breaker of water, had been drinking in
what they could understand of this conversation.
Their work finished, they stood by the
bow of the boat and looked at each other for
a moment, silent.  At length Li Fu spoke,
impassively, unconcerned.
</p>

<p>
"To the superior man, duty is as a clear star
shining in the night."
</p>

<p>
"So it is written," agreed Hi John.  "Give
me your revolver and cartridges."
</p>

<p>
"Haste treads upon the tail of a tiger,"
dissented Li Fu reflectively.  "Here is the
revolver.  Let us see to whom the gods assign it.
Shall a white man be braver than we?"
</p>

<p>
"Very well."
</p>

<p>
Li Fu tossed his revolver in the air.  It
spun, end over end, and spinning, fell down
into the sand.  The butt fell toward Li Fu,
who stooped and picked it up.
</p>

<p>
"Now give me yours," he said.
</p>

<p>
Hi John obeyed without protest, passing
over his revolver and what spare cartridges
he had in his pockets.  Then he turned and
walked to Barnes and Nora Sayers, who had
watched this scene curiously.  He addressed
the girl.
</p>

<p>
"Missee, I think mebbeso you can row
plenty good?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course!" she exclaimed.  "Of course I
can!"
</p>

<p>
"Then you row along me," said Hi John.
"Li Fu, he stop here."
</p>

<p>
Barnes growled something under his
breath, and walked over to Li Fu.
</p>

<p>
"What's this mean?" he demanded.  "You
get in that boat and row, d'you understand?"
</p>

<p>
Li Fu regarded him placidly, without
emotion, his yellow features very composed.
</p>

<p>
"You go hellee," he said, and then grinned.
"My stop along you.  Savvy?  Missee plenty
stlong, use oar plenty good!  You go hellee."
</p>

<p>
What he saw in those calm eyes checked
the words on the lips of Barnes.  He turned
and went to the boat, and waded out along the
gunwale until he was beside the figure of
Ellen Maggs.  With an effort, he stooped and
touched his lips to her still cheek.
</p>

<p>
"Good-by, girl!" he whispered, and then
straightened.  "Get the kids, Nora!  Come
on, pile in; time to get off!  Get as far as you
can before it gets dark.  Wrap a cloth about
your hands, too; they'll be blistered quick
enough."
</p>

<p>
Collecting the children, Nora Sayers got
into the boat.  She held out her hand to
Barnes, who gripped it and smiled cheerfully.
</p>

<p>
"Good-by," she said, her voice breaking.
"I wish you'd let me wake her up!  She'd
want to say&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"She'd say I needed a shave damn bad," and
Barnes chuckled as he made reply.  "You
settle down on this thwart.  All ready, men?
Shove off.  Good luck to you, Nora!  Wrap
your hands, now, before you get started.  See
you later!"
</p>

<p>
The boat glided out, Hi John scrambling
aboard as she cleared the sand.  Nora Sayers
tried to answer, but could not.  Barnes stood
beside Li Fu and waved his hand.
</p>

<p>
The boat slowly drew up-river under the
pull of the two oars and vanished around the
head of the islet.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap08"></a></p>

<h3>
VIII
</h3>

<p>
"Watch and watch, Li Fu," said Barnes,
when night settled down on the islet, the
river-mouth and the booming surf.  "I'm
done in.  Wake me at midnight; they'll not
come until then."
</p>

<p>
"Not then, I think," said Li Fu.  "China
boys not like night devils.  Plenty devils in
liver."
</p>

<p>
"All right," Barnes laughed as he
stretched out in the warm sand.  "Let the
river-devils fight for us, then!"
</p>

<p>
About midnight the quartermaster wakened
him.  There had been no alarm, no
sound or sight of the enemy.  Only the
continuous rolling crash of the surf, regular and
unceasing, conflicted with the noises of nightbirds
from the jungle.  The starlight and thin
glow of the sickle moon faintly illumined the
white sands and the glittering waters, where
the waves curled and broke in running lines
of phosphorescent radiance.
</p>

<p>
At first Barnes found Li Fu's conviction
incredible.  It was hard to believe that Lim
Tock's lascars and Chinese, the latter
probably predominating, would relinquish the
opportunity to sweep in upon the islet with their
boats and finish everything with one determined
rush.  The Chinese firmly credited the
existence of water-devils, however, and
river-devils in particular, whose power at night was
invincible.
</p>

<p>
Barnes sat through his lonely watch, stiff
and aching from his wound, and found no
indication of alarm out on the surging waters,
where a heavy ground-swell kept the rollers
tumbling in along the shoreline.  He began
to think that he had wasted himself, despite
all.  Had he stayed in the boat, it by this time
would be far up the river.
</p>

<p>
He laughed and shook off the thought.
After all, he had no assurance of that!  The
boat, with only two oars, might be a day or
two in reaching the main river above the
delta, where the Dutch post would be placed.
With dawn, the pirates would sweep down on
the island.  If they found it deserted, they
would go up the river with a rush.  No, the
effort was not wasted; was far from wasted!
</p>

<p>
Toward dawn he roused Li Fu, and lay
down once more to get all the rest possible.
When the quartermaster again wakened him,
it was to point out dark dots on the waters,
now overcast with the graying dawn.  The
boats, four of them, were scattered a quarter-mile
from the river mouth, up and down from
the bar.  Jim Barnes laughed softly.
</p>

<p>
"They think we'll come out with the first
breath o' wind; that we've been waiting here
for the breeze!  And they're waiting to
riddle us with their rifles, then close in.  Good!
Let 'em wait.  Every minute gained puts the
whaleboats farther up the river.  Suppose we
make some tea, Li Fu.  The fire will show
that we're here and encourage 'em to wait."
</p>

<p>
Chuckling at all this, Li Fu gathered wood
and soon had a fire going.  Hot tea and
biscuit invigorated Barnes hugely, and he was
much himself again by the time the reddening
dawn and freshening daylight betrayed to the
waiting boats that the fugitives were not
setting forth from shore.  No doubt they
considered that Barnes had laid up the whaleboat
and was prepared to fight it out.
</p>

<p>
"They're closing in," said Barnes suddenly.
"Oars are out.  The junk is coming down the
coast, too.  She'll probably anchor off the
river, and they'll pour in a hot rifle-fire before
making a rush.  Dig for cover, Li!"
</p>

<p>
Grasping the idea, Li Fu took his knife to
the sand and prepared two long, deep depressions
at the edge of the brush.
</p>

<p>
Meantime, one of the boats drew in closer
than the others as though to test the presence
of those on the islet.  Barnes sighed unavailingly
for a rifle, as his pistols were of small
value at such distance.  He tried two shots,
however, and by sheer luck dropped the boat's
helmsman, so that she sheered off promptly.
The boats opened a dropping rifle-fire, and
Barnes retired to the position prepared.
Lying beside Li Fu, he waited.  He had three
automatics and several spare clips.  The
quartermaster had two revolvers and a
handful of loose cartridges.
</p>

<p>
Under the urge of the ground-swell, surf
was now breaking in a heavy line at the bar,
an outer line of breakers stretching twenty
yards farther seaward.  While the boats kept
up their intermittent fire, bullets crashing
across the island, the junk came slowly along
with the morning breeze.  Outside the first
line of surf she dropped anchor and hauled
down the brown matting sails, and the boats
converged upon her.  Streamers and fingers
of flame were reaching across the whole
eastern sky.
</p>

<p>
"Plenty of men aboard her," said Barnes.
"They'll crowd into the boats and pull for us.
Catch the first boat as she rises, Li, like we did
last night.  If one of them goes over in that
surf, not a man will reach shore.  Good gosh,
look at her rise up!  They're fools if they try
it."
</p>

<p>
To the two men lying on the sandy islet,
the surf promised indeed to be an excellent
protection.  The roaring breakers swept on
and hurled up into a great wall of white and
crimson spray, against the sunrise, a ten-foot
wall of curling, foaming water whose impact
as it came down made the islet shake and sent
a booming roar echoing along the coast.  The
tide was coming in, and there was a strong rip
along the bar.
</p>

<p>
Now the sun was up, in a gleaming splendor
of golden glory.
</p>

<p>
As each glittering line of surf swept up and
curled, it hid from sight the boats and all save
the upper masts of the junk herself.  Between
the surges, the rifle-fire was maintained steadily,
but Li Fu and Barnes were well protected
against the ripping storm of lead that devastated
the foliage above and ploughed the sand
into ripples of dancing grains.
</p>

<p>
"They come," said Li Fu suddenly.
</p>

<p>
The next surf-interval showed a crowded
boat leaving the junk.  The craft damaged
on the preceding evening by Hi John's bullet
must have sunk, for it appeared that now
there were but two whaleboats among the
four approaching craft.  One of those,
however, would do the business, thought Jim
Barnes grimly.
</p>

<p>
Covered by a hot fire from the rifles, the
first boat reached in for the surf, her oars
dipping strongly, the other boats following her.
She was a bluff-jawed longboat belonging to
the junk, dangerously crowded with men, and
Barnes caught the flame of naked steel as she
lifted on a crest.  He thrilled to the
possibility of sending her over as she struck the
white wall to cleave a way through.  Not a
man would reach shore through the pounding
maelstrom of those waters.
</p>

<p>
Thundering and shuddering, a long breaker
smashed and swirled across the bar, and now
the longboat dipped oars and gathered way to
rise on the next crest and come over.  A whirl
of bullets heralded her coming.  Then, as the
riotous crest closed in and lifted her and the
shots ceased, Barnes came to one knee.  He
had her position absolutely fixed, and aimed
carefully, firing even before she came into
sight.
</p>

<p>
She heaved and lifted, cleaving the water.
Barnes fired again and again, hearing the
bark of Li Fu's revolver at his side.  A mad
yell broke from the Chinese.  Barnes lowered
his arm and stared, wide-eyed.
</p>

<p>
That first shot of his, perhaps, had done the
work; had sent a rower headlong at the
crucial instant.  At the very crest of the giant
wave, the boat broached, was sent stern-first.
A shriek burst from the score of men crowded
into her, a fearful, splitting shriek that
wrenched through the roar of the surf.  Then
she was picked up, hurled end over end from
the crest of the wave, flung sideways, and went
upside down beneath the terrific smash of
that falling pinnacle of water.
</p>

<p>
A lather of foam spread out from the sweeping
rush of the breaker, but not a man showed
in it.  They were held down, dragged out
with the backlash, gripped and flung about
with the mad swirl under the surface.  The
boat itself, a crushed and broken thing, came
into sight, was tugged out and into the next
surf-crest, to be whirled horribly aloft and
buried again; but no man of all her crew appeared.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The whiff of a bullet made Barnes wake
up, and he flung himself into the sand.  Li
Fu was yelling in an ecstasy of delight.  Then,
at the next interval, Barnes realized that the
other boats were coming forward&mdash;two whale-boats,
and a smaller craft.
</p>

<p>
"Lascars!" yelled Li Fu.  "Plenty joss
along Lim Tock!"
</p>

<p>
The Malays were rowing these boats; seamen
unsurpassed.  Well, this was the end of
it; useless everything that had been done, once
these boats came through.  Barnes caught the
arm of the yellow man.
</p>

<p>
"Empty one gun&mdash;then reload and wait.  Savvy?"
</p>

<p>
Li Fu nodded hastily.  The two whale-boats
came on abreast, rowed with precision,
a brown Malay at each steering crutch, the
long oars rising and dipping and hurling her
forward with absolute surety.  Up they rose
and up, then forward and down, as though
leaping from that high curling wall into the
water beyond!
</p>

<p>
Barnes found himself firing mechanically,
firing until the hammer clicked on nothing
and he slipped one of his extra clips into the
weapon.  Useless!  A sudden inarticulate
cry escaped his lips.  The last bullet had
brought down the steersman of the boat to the
left.  Almost through, she broached and
swerved.  The water swung her about, caught
up her keel and spilled her men into the
smother.  She was sent rolling along, crushing
the men beneath her, pounding on the sand
until the undertow dragged her out and away.
</p>

<p>
But the other boat was through.  It drove
forward toward the islet with a wild yell lifting
from the men aboard, and rifles spattering
lead.  And now the smaller boat was in the
surf, and riding it.
</p>

<p>
"Back!" shouted Barnes.  "Back to cover,
Li!  Fire and reload while I fire."
</p>

<p>
From the shelter of the brush, Li Fu
emptied his two revolvers into the boat.  He
could hardly miss at this distance, as she came
foaming to the shore.  Barnes could see the
figure of Lim Tock crouching amidships, a
bandage about his head.  Men went down,
brown and yellow men crowded between her
thwarts.  Rifles and revolvers sent bullets
hailing at the trees, and with the impetus that
was upon her, she came in and her nose
touched the beach.
</p>

<p>
Barnes was ready, cool, imperturbable.  The
first man that leaped from her, he dropped;
and the second, and the third.  Then the boat
tipped, and brown and yellow came ashore in
a mass, Lim Tock heading them.  Krisses
and knives flamed in the sunlight.  The
smaller boat was reaching into the shore now.
The end was at hand.
</p>

<p>
Into the mass Barnes planted his bullets
steadily.  One gun was empty, now the other.
No time to reload&mdash;he dropped them and
seized that of Ellen Maggs.  Only three or
four men left, Lim Tock heading them!  Then
a new burst of yells, and from the last boat
poured a dozen fresh assailants, with the
serang Gajah at their head, his unhealed scalp
wound red and ominous in the sunlight.
</p>

<p>
A scream of battle-madness burst from Li
Fu.  He leaped forward, out into the open,
and ran at the newcomers.  Pistols barked;
krisses glittered.  Barnes saw the quartermaster
come to grips with Gajah, and the two
men went rolling in the sand.  Then, smiling,
he lifted his weapon and shot.
</p>

<p>
Lim Tock took the bullet between the eyes,
and sprawled forward.  Barnes laughed, and
shot again.  Then he ducked back into the
brush.  An instant later, the brown and
yellow men came on in a wave, mad with the
battle fury, blind and deaf to everything
around them, intent only upon the white man
who had eluded them.
</p>

<p>
From among the trees the weapon of
Barnes barked out its last shots.

<h3>
IX
</h3>

<p>
The patrol launch belonging to the
Bulungan River post, commanded by.
Controleur Opdyke and manned by stalwart
Achinese sepoys, sped swiftly down the
northern branch of the mighty river.  The
controleur was highly nervous, for this
navigation in the early dawn was an unaccustomed
and perilous thing; further, the girl who
stood beside him, and the tall Chinese at her
elbow, were continually urging him to greater
speed.
</p>

<p>
Then came the first gleams of sunrise, and
the spattering of shots from below&mdash;and the
prim, alert controleur needed no further
urging.  At his swift command the speed was
increased, and the brown sepoys stripped the
cover from the one-pounder up forward.
</p>

<p>
Rifles were brought up and loaded.
</p>

<p>
They burst into full view of the river-mouth
just as the smaller boat came to the
islet and poured forth her men and the wild
charge forward was begun.  Controleur Opdyke
perceived instantly that he could not get
through the surf to the junk.  Being a man
of distinct character, he did not hesitate.  Two
orders passed his lips.  At the first, the gun
crew threw in a shell and sighted; at the
second, the rifles began to speak along the
forward deck.
</p>

<p>
The little pom-pom barked, and the shell
exploded above the junk.  It barked again,
and scored a hit.  Again, and the junk reeled
and staggered.  Then the Achinese were leaping
overboard and pouring ashore, and among
them Hi John.
</p>

<p>
And after them, despite the imploring
commands of the officer, Ellen Maggs.
</p>

<p>
Jim Barnes came face to face with her as
he squirmed out of the brush and brushed the
blood from his eyes.  A kris had slithered
athwart his scalp; for a moment he thought
she was a vision, standing there in the fresh
sunlight, her eyes fastened upon him, her
hands outreaching.  Then he heard her voice.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Jim, Jim!  If you had only known&mdash;it
was barely five miles up to the post!  And
we were hours getting there.  Thank God,
you're alive!"
</p>

<p>
It was quite as a matter of course that Jim
Barnes took her in his arms and held her close
to him for a long moment.  Speech came hard.
There was everything to say, and nothing.
Suddenly he realized that she was trembling.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Jim!  You'll have to help me.  I&mdash;I
told an awful lie&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She was frightened, nervous, tearful, and
yet a smile crept into her-blushing cheeks as
she looked up into his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Who to, me?" he asked, returning the smile.
</p>

<p>
"No.  To&mdash;to the controleur.  Controleur
Updyke.  He was terribly severe about it all.
He wouldn't bring Nora, and he wasn't going
to bring me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What was the lie?" asked Barnes, puzzled.
</p>

<p>
Then he looked up to see the officer striding
toward them.  He realized abruptly that the
little brown soldiers had been very busy all
over the islet.
</p>

<p>
"Der junk hass sunk," said the controleur,
taking off his helmet.  "Diss iss Mynheer
Parnes?  I am pleassed to meet you, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Same to you," and Barnes grinned as he
put out his hand.  Even the primness of
Opdyke could not meet that grin without an
answering smile.  "Controleur Opdyke?
I'm sure much obliged to you.  Just came
along in time."
</p>

<p>
"Ja.  I am glad.  Your vrouw, Madame
Parnes, she hurried us.  Dat wass goot,
too."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, so that's it!"  Barnes laughed out
suddenly, and caught Ellen Maggs to him.  "You
little rascal, you!  Told him you were my
wife, eh?  Well, you will be as quick as it
can be managed&mdash;won't you?  Say yes!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Jim,"-she murmured.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Barnes turned.
</p>

<p>
"Where's Li Fu?" he demanded.  "That
Chinese chap who stayed with me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"He iss badly hurt, but all right," said
Opdyke, beginning to understand things a little.
"Sir, dere must be reports made, und prisoners
must be&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Forget it, forget it!" said Barnes, and
laughed happily.  "This is Miss Maggs,
Controleur.  She told you a lie.  She's not
my wife, but is going to be.  Will you forgive
her?"
</p>

<p>
Controleur Opdyke met the eyes of Ellen
Maggs.  Suddenly he smiled, and tendered
her a very deep bow.
</p>

<p>
"Diss young man, he iss very lucky," he
said.  "<i>Mejuffvrouw</i>, shall I make you
happy, yes?  Den, dere iss a missionary at de
post.  Now, if you eggscuse me, I must look
after dese t'ings."
</p>

<p>
He turned and walked stiffly away toward
his men, who were rounding up sullen
captives.  But Jim Barnes looked-down into the
shining eyes of the girl.
</p>

<p>
"Ellen!  Remember that bungalow on the
hill above Sausalito that I told you about?
Do you really want it&mdash;and a husband who's
a sailor and hasn't a lot o' money?  Or would
you sooner go back to China?"
</p>

<p>
A smile lightened in her face.
</p>

<p>
"I'm tired of China, Jim," she said.
</p>

<p>
Delightedly, Barnes caught her to him
again and stooped to her lips.  Then, with a
happy laugh, he straightened up.
</p>

<p>
"Missionary at the post, eh?  Hurray!
Let's go!"
</p>

<p>
"Aye, aye, sir," she said obediently.  "Go
it is, sir&mdash;steady as she is!"
</p>
